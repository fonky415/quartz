There are two main types of interactions organisms can have in an ecosystem. One is competition, which is where organisms have to fight for some limited biotic and/or aboitic resource, and the other is symbiosis, which is where organisms benefit or harm from another for their own benefit.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://fonky415.github.io/quartz/Obsidian/phillip/School/Science/Ecology/14.4-Population-Growth-Patterns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fonky415.github.io/quartz/Obsidian/phillip/School/Science/Ecology/14.4-Population-Growth-Patterns/</guid><description>14.4 Population Growth Patterns Created: 2022-05-13 05:51
Populations grow in predictable patterns.
Direct Factors in population size Population size is constantly changing due to four constantly changing factors: Births Births of new individuals increase the population size Immigration Movement of individuals from a population into another Emigration Movement of individuals from a population out to another Deaths Death of individuals within a population decreases its size Population growth Depending on the environment and its available resources, the growth of a species can either be very rapid or slow.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://fonky415.github.io/quartz/Obsidian/phillip/School/Science/Ecology/16.2-Air-Quality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fonky415.github.io/quartz/Obsidian/phillip/School/Science/Ecology/16.2-Air-Quality/</guid><description>16.2 Air Quality Created: 2022-06-14 07:07
