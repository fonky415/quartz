-   **Flat character.** A flat character has one or two personality traits that don't change. The flat character can play a major or a minor role.
-   **Round character.** A round character has many complex traits; those traits develop and change in a story. A round character seems more real than a flat character because real people are complex.
-   **Stock or stereotype character.** Stock characters are stereotypes, such as hot-tempered redheads, stingy businessmen, and absent-minded professors. They are often found in genre fiction (romance novels and mysteries, for example), and are usually flat characters. They are often used as a tool to move a plot forward.
-   **Static character.** A static character never changes. A loud, obnoxious "background" character who remains the same throughout the story is static. A boring character who is never changed by events is also static.
-   **Dynamic character.** Unlike a static character, a dynamic character does change and grow as the story unfolds. Dynamic characters respond to events and experience changes in attitude or outlook. The character might go through a transformation during the course of the storyline, and grow as a result of actions that took place.
