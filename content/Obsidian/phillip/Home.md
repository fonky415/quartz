# Home
Welcome to Phillip's vault. Here, I make notes on everything I learn, from the [[Korean War]] to [[Melody & Counterpoint|harmony in music]]. Here, you can get a sense of how to navigate through what might seem like hundreds of random notes, but really are just individual notes that serve its own purpose. 

I started this since March 28, 2022. 

## Folders 
Every note in this vault falls under the **Life folder, School folder, or the Obsidian folder** 
As you might have already guessed, my Life folder is where I keep everything that I do for myself, for my life. Whether I'm jotting down ideas to come back to later, or taking notes on an interesting topic, notes that are under the Life folder are one made purely from my self-interest. 

Then I have my School folder, where, as you might have already guessed, I have my school-related notes here. I make notes for most of my **school classes**, and although I don't find all of it uninteresting, there are some places within my School folder where I will most likely never return to again. 

And lastly, there is my Obsidian folder. Here are **notes for other notes**, meaning that these notes aren't to read through or reference, but to serve for other notes. For example, all my attachments (pictures, pdfs, etc.) are stored there, as well as the templates I use for my notes. You won't have to go in there, but no one's stopping you.
