Just a few things in this book that I thought would be worthwhile to jot down. 

## 1: Schoolteachers and Sumo Wrestlers 
- Economics: “the study of incentives” 
	- **Incentive:** “means of urging people to do more of a good thing and less of a bad thing”
		- Three types: economic, social, moral 

>[!Cite] Whatever the incentive, whatever the situatoin, dishonest people will try to gain an advantage by whatever means necessary.

- There is “innate honesty [in] mankind”
>[!Cite] How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it. –Adam Smith

## 2: The KKK and Real-Estate Agents 
- **Power of information** 
	- People who hoard information (KKK, real-estate agents, doctors, etc.) can be undermined by *making information more accessible* 
- The Internet was a major factor in the equalization of [[information asymmetry ]]
- The abuse of information asymmetry doesn’t make the real-estate agent a bad person–it just makes them *a person*, who has their own incentives 
	- And their incentives might go against you sometimes, and sometimes it will go with 

>>[!tldr] Summary 
>>An ideal world ruled by morality is vastly different from the reality of economics. It’s up to us to choose which one to be in.
