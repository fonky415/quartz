BUYING THE DIP IS GOOD, BUY P&G WHEN IT’S LOW 
- - - 

Governments are hiking interest rates all around the world, the Russo-Ukrainan war continues to wage, the S&P 500 dips in bearish territory, but most importantly, Greg gets up every morning, brushes his teeth, and shampoos his hair. Regardless of current events, Greg always buys his tooshpaste and shampoo every couple of months from the same exact brand and uses those products every single day. I think you know where this is headed to, but you probably already knew because it’s on the title–we buy Procter & Gamble, or P&G. 

I’m sure you are already familiar with P&G and use their products, but if you aren’t, here’s a quick rundown of what the company does. 

First of all, P&G works in the Household & Personal Products industry, according to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PG/profile?p=PG), and sells packaged goods to “North and Latin America, Europe, the Asia Pacific, Greater China, India, the Middle East, and Africa.” In other words, the entire world. ([Except for Cuba and North Korea.](https://us.pg.com/blogs/pg-2019-annual-report/)) If you’re unsure what kinds of products this is, here are some photos of products that you might’ve seen, or used before:

Yes–all those brands are owned by one parent company–P&G. P&G didn’t make those brands themselves though. They just bought it to remove any competition. 

Secondly, P&G gives dividends. A good amount of it, in fact. As of June 10, 2022, P&G gives [$0.913 per share](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/pg/dividend-history) every quarter, and has always increased it every year. The annual dividend yield for one stock is [2.49%](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/pg/dividend-history), which, compared to the S&P 500’s[ 1.4-1.5%](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/071616/history-sp-500-dividend-yield.asp), is not bad, especially considering that its dividend history shows a constant decrease since 2008. (Keep in mind that these calculations are *not* accounting for inflation. With the Feds combating inflation, however, things might turn out better for people owning 
dividend stocks.)

What are some other fundamentals that make P&G look good? The P/E ratio in the TTM is 25.36, which, compared to 30.01 peak on December 29, 2021, is pretty low. The RSI too, with 14 close, is 37.19 as of June 10, 2022, signalled that this stock may be undervalued right now. There are many more attractive fundamentals of this company that I don’t fully understand, like its high Sharpe ratio. I would recommend browsing through Reddit for educational purposes more about P&G. 

The point is, P&G is a defensive stock. According to James Chen from Investopedia, a defensive stock is “[…] a stock that provides consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall stock market.” Chen argues that although defensive stocks “tend to perform better than the broader market during recessions,” they “tend to perform below the market” when it’s doing well. And clearly, the market isn’t doing so well. P&G’s beta is 0.39, meaning that if the market moves 1%, P&G will likely follow it by only 0.39%. As Chen explained it, this means less losses in a bearish market, but also less gains in a bullish one. But considering the state of the market right now, I believe that it’s wiser to be safer with our investments and not lose all our money. 

How exactly are we going to invest? We aren’t just going to buy and hold–we are going to use DCA, or dollar cost averaging. This is an investment strategy that works pretty well. To be honest, I don’t rly have time to explain what it is and i'm sure you alr know anyway, so there you go.
