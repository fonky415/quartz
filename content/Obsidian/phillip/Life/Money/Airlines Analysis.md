## Fund Overview
The U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) is an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), mostly investing in the top 50 companies in North America by market cap in the airlines industry. The fund includes large, mid, and small market cap companies. The top 10 companies by market cap are below with their respective weightings:

In this fund, the sectors Aerospace & Defense, Hotels, Resorts & Cruise Lines, and Air Freight & Logistics are included. We believe that the airline industry, despite its current susceptibility to world events, will pull through like it always has, and continue to grow in the long term. 

## Market Condition 
The two major factors in the airlines market currently is COVID-19 and the Russo-Ukrainian War. COVID-19 started spreading in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and the Russo-Ukrainian War began in February of 2014. 

### COVID-19 
Due to travel restrictions imposed by the government for COVID-19 precautions, the airlines industry suffered greatly in 2020. Number of passengers plummeted by 60%, which was reflected on the revenue as well. Three years later, travel restrictions have eased considerably in the US. Some countries require a negative COVID-19 test, others a full vaccination record, and even others require quarantine for a period of time after arrival. (USNews) As it will be shown below in the "Upward Trends" section, passenger numbers have significantly recovered since 2020, and will continue to grow. 

### Russo-Ukrainian War 
For the airlines industry, the Russo-Ukrainian War has done two major things: hike up oil prices and reduce passengers. Russia is an important exporter of oil in Europe as aforementioned and has increased oil prices in the US by X%, a common pattern in history with oil and war.

In 2011 due to political conflict in the Mideast and North Africa, there was also an oil price hike that peaked at $112/barrel and averaged $111, compared to the $79 average price in 2010.  ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011â€“2013_world_oil_market_chronology)) Despite a drop in profits from the previous year, the airlines industry saw a 9.4% revenue increase, to $598 billion. ([IATA](https://www.iata.org/contentassets/c81222d96c9a4e0bb4ff6ced0126f0bb/annual-review-2012.pdf)) 

Also due to the war, many airplane routes had to be rerouted to a longer trip or were canceled completely, as Russia had placed reciprocal air blockades and made it very risky for airplanes to fly above. This, in turn, increased oil consumption, which led to the increase in fare prices, an unattractive force of events for both airline companies and passengers alike. For example, the Japan Airlines Flight JL43 from Tokyo to London flies a Boeing 777-300ER saw a 20% increase in fuel consumption from the rerouting, burning 5,600 more gallons of fuel. (Source: [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/24/world/flights-reroute-around-russia-carbon-cost-climate/index.html)) The increase in fare prices, however, won't leave a dent in consumer demand in the airlines industry. According to the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) 9th economic briefing, "[...]passengers are relatively insensitive to air travel prices at a national aggregate market level, and even less so at a supra-national level[...]". IATA estimated the demand elasticity levels in Table 3:

This shows the relative inelasticity of the market, proving that higher fares won't affect consumer demand significantly. 

## Upward Trends 
Over the past two decades, the airlines industry has mostly grown in terms of revenue. After the 2008 recession, it only took 2 years for the industry to grow further than before, showing the long-term, unrelenting growth potential of US airlines.

After the COVID-19 outbreak in 2019, the airlines industry took a great hit due to travel restrictions. As seen below, annual passengers on US airlines dropped from 927 million to 369 million, a 60% decrease. In just one year, however, as travel bans loosened and people got vaccinated among other reasons, there were 30% more passengers in 2021. It is evident that 2020 was simply a dip, and the upward trend will not stop.

One reason for this could be business travelers. 12% of all passengers are flying somewhere for business-related reasons, but because businesses want their employees to be in the best shape when they arrive, they usually spend more money than the average passenger. This makes them a major source of profit for airline companies, with some being 75% of their passenger consumer revenue. ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041315/how-much-revenue-airline-industry-comes-business-travelers-compared-leisure-travelers.asp)) As long as businesses exist, business travelers will exist, providing reliable and consistent revenue for airline companies. Furthermore, business travel spending saw continuous increase before COVID-19, showing its resilience in the volatile market.

Now that COVID-19 precautions are starting to ease, pent-up demand from nearly three years of COVID-19 will give airline companies the boost from the lows of COVID-19. 

As a last note, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) themselves in their FAA Aerospace Forecast (Fiscal Years 2021-2041) has only forecasted growth in the demand of passenger aircraft.

## Risks 
The major risk with the airline industry is that it is very sensitive. Climate change, oil prices, and government precautionary measures are just a few of the many factors that can significantly affect the airline industry. This results in a very fluctuant stock price, as there are constant updates on said factors and many investors trade rashly from the frequent news. Long-term investors, however, know that through all the fluctuations, there indeed is a positive slope, even if it takes 6 months or a year to show. 

## Conclusion 
Despite the turbulence the airline industry faces and has been facing for quite some time now, history has proven its endurance to such volatility in many cases, including 2008, 2011, and 2020. Revenue and demand is rising, as COVID-19 cases and fuel required per hour is falling. And as the world returns physical from virtual, the airlines industry will be there to make it happen.
