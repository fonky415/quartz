# Melody & Counterpoint 
Created: 2022-05-07 12:51  

quick description of chapter 

### Terms and Concepts  
- 

## Melody 
- All are singable 
- The flow of the melody has at least a somewhat **logical path** 
- Intervals between notes (melodic intervals) are usually small 

### Characteristics 
- Has a **strong sense of key** 
	- Most end on the $\hat{1}$ 
- Arches in the melody line 
	- Most go up then down, but some go down then up 

### How to write a melody 
1. Start the melody on one of the notes of the tonic triad ($\hat{1},\hat{3},\hat{5}$) 
2. Set the [[range]] of the melody to less than 11 notes and put most of the melody within a [[tessitura]] (sixth interval) 
3. Use [[conjunct motion]] primarily, not [[disjunct motion]] when moving with the melody 
4. When using disjunct motion, however, they should: 
	1. Still be pretty small leaps (try to keep them under a perfect fifth) 
	2. Make the leaps [[consonant]] (not dissonant) 
	3. Resolve tensions 
	4. Fill in the musical space made from the disjunct motion 
		1. Called the "law of recovery" 
		2. Needed for larger intervals such as a fifth 
	5. Be usually not consecutive 
	6. Avoid too repetitive patterns/sequences (ex. 123,234,345) 
	7. Make a logical shape with the melody 
		1. Common shape: arch that goes up to the [[melodic climax]] then goes back down 
5. [[Melodic cadence]]: end the melody with the two-pitch pattern ($\hat{2}-\hat{1}\space or\space \hat{7}-\hat{1}$)

Melody B is much more singable and memorable for a plethora or reasons: 
1. The melody starts on one of the notes of the triad of the tonic (C, E, G), C, while melody A starts in F, which is not one of the notes. 
2. The range of melody A exceeds 10 notes: it ranges from C to F an octave higher, spanning 11 notes. Melody B, on the other hand, only has a range from C to A, which is 6 notes.
