# cool voicings/chords i found 
Created: 2022-05-24 19:46  

The exercise is this: I play random notes on the piano at once, then try to discern which chord it is and, if it sounds good, try to use it, and if it doesn’t, try to change a note or two or use the dissonance for a transition. 

## minor second on the bass 
- when doing using the minor second (m2), put it in the bass and it puts more tension 
	- resolving it sounds hella good 
![[Sunae-dong.m4a]]

## maj7 on the bass 
- when using maj7, try put that in the base and the top note as one of the triads 
	- idk just gives a rly unsettling sound 

## ?? 
- spooky, surreal sound 
	- Notes: C - C# - F# - Bb - B 
- Kind of works when you’re in the key of F# for the first example 
![[Sunae-dong 2.m4a]]

## transitition into subdominant 
- iii+7 (b9) 
	- also just sharp 5, flat 9, with 7
	- In the audio, this is Dmin+7b9 
- **OR** Isus2sus4maj7/iii
	- In the audio, this is Bbsus2sus4maj7/D 
![[Sunae-dong 3.m4a]]
Example of how it could be used(?): 
![[Sunae-dong 4.m4a]]

## Cool way to use flat 9 
- A/C or VI/I 
- Just play tonic and play the 6th major chord 
	- In the example, the base was C major and I just played A major in first inversion (A/C#) at the top 
![[Sunae-dong 5.m4a]]

## Minor third as base 
- Gm/Bb or i/iii 
- FIrst recording is with the fifth on top 
![[Sunae-dong 6.m4a]]
- second recording is with the C on top, giving a more sus4 feel, you could even call that a Bb6add9 chord if you want to go another direction 
![[Sunae-dong 7.m4a]]
You can go so many directions with this; even modulations 

## Sus2 chords but only play 2 and 5 while the bass goes down 

- In the example, we start with Fm2 → Eb6 →Dbmaj7b5
