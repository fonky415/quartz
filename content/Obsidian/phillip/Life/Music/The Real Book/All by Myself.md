## Notes 
- During this part: ![[Screen Shot 2022-06-22 at 8.53.35 PM.png]] use second inversion for Am7 and Dm7 so that when you do the next chord, all you need to do is change the bottom note halfway. Cool transition chord. 
- Same thing for this part: ![[Screen Shot 2022-06-22 at 8.56.07 PM.png]]you have the descending bass from C, B, Bb, then A, with only the bass moving down. Just add the C# for the A7. So cool.
