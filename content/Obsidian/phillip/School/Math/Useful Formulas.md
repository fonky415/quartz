## z-score
$$Z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$$
$x$ = raw score, $\mu$ = sample mean, $\sigma$ = standard deviation of sample 
**A score that tells you how far away from the mean you are.** 
	A z-score of less than 1 would be one standard deviation away from the mean, meaning that 68% of the data matches yours. The higher the z-score, the further you are from the mean. Can be both negative and positive. 

## Margin of error (quantitative)
$$E≈\frac{2\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$
$\sigma$ = standard deviation of sample, $n$ = sample size

## Conditional Probability 
This calculates the likelihood of an event given that another event has already happened. 
$$P(B|A)=\frac{P(B\cap A)}{P(A)} \space with \space P(A)≠0$$
