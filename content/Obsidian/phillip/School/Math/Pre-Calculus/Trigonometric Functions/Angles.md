# Angles 

Quick review on angles. 

![[7.2 Angles and the Unit Circle#Standard position]]
![[7.2 Angles and the Unit Circle#REMEMBER TO ADD A NEGATIVE SIGN BEFORE THE NEGATIVE ANGLE MEASURE]]

## Coterminal 
Angles in standard position that **share the terminal side.**

>[!note] You can have negative degrees.
>If the angle goes counterclockwise, you have negative degrees.

### Example 
**Give one positive and one negative *coterminal angle.*

1. 10º 
$10+360=370$
$10-360=-350$

>Positive: 370. Negative: -350

2. 575º
$575+360=935$
$575-360-360=-145$

>Positive: 935º. Negative: -145º. 

## DMS 
Degrees, Minutes, Seconds 

| Decimal Degrees | DMS        |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| 12.46º          | 12º27’36”  |
|      120º.507           | 120º30’24” |

### Decimal Degrees to DMS 
1. Whole number part (degrees) is always the same. 
2. Multiply the remaining decimals by 60, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. 
3. The resulting product (only whole number part) is the minutes.
4. Multiply the remainder by 60 again, as there are 60 seconds in a minute. 
5. The resulting product is the seconds.

### DMS to Decimal Degrees 
1. The degrees stay the same. 
2. Multiply the minutes by 60. (60 minutes in an hour)
3. Multiply the seconds by 3600. (3600 seconds in an hour)
4. Add them all together.
