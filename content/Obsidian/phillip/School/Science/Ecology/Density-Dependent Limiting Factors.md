# Density-Dependent Limiting Factors 
Created: 2022-06-08 08:11  

- Limiting factors that **are affected by the density of the population** 
- **Competition** 
	- [[14.2 Community Interactions#Intraspecific competition|Intraspecific competition]] for resources increases as the population grows denser, and vice versa 
	- More competition → less resources → limit in population 
- **Predation**
	- Population of predator is caused by the population of prey 
		- More prey → more predator 
		- Less prey → less predator 
	- Population of predator and prey go through cycles

- **Parasitism and disease** 
	- Parasites and diseases can spread more quickly through dense populations than less dense ones 
	- Parasites and diseases also can cause the population to decrease 
	- Dense population → more parasites & diseases → less dense population → fewer parasites & diseases → more dense population…
