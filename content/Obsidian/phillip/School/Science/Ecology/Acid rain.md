**:type of precipitation produced when pollutants in the water cycle cause rain pH to drop below normal levels**

## How itâ€™s formed 
- The nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides turn into nitric and sulfuric acids, lowering the pH under 5.6
	- 5.6 is the normal level because of carbonic acid 

## Impact on the ecosystem  
- Can decrease pH levels in lakes and streams, threatening the entire ecosystem there 
- Cause a decline in growth rates in plants 
- Cause leaves and bark to break down more quickly 
- Make plants more vulnerable to disease and weather
