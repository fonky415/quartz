# Lake Grace lab organizer 
Created: 2022-05-27 06:03  

**Claim: The sport fish population of Lake Grace is decreasing in size due to the use of herbicides **

## Key events 
- **1998:** invasive species, such as hydrilla and water hyacinth are found in Lake Grace for the first time 
- **2001:** a large hog farm is built after farmers stopped raising crops and sold part of their land to developers 
- **2004:** herbicides are introduced to the lake to slow the spread of invasive water plants in Lake Grace 

## Water quality 
- **Nitrate levels** over 30 ppm can be bad for fish but good for aquatic plants 
	- When nitrate reacts with water, nitric acid (pH 3) is formed 
	- nitrate went up because of hog farm 
		- water from irrigation got released back into lake containing fertilizers 
		- this increased algae 
		- that increased daphnia population 
		- that increased all three sport fish population 
		- herbicides brought the plants population down, including invasive species and algae 
		- this brought all the population down as that’s their main food source 
- **Phosphate levels** of 0.01 - 0.03 mg/L is okay, but 0.025 - 0.1 mg/L will stimulate plant growth 
	- When phosphate reacts with water, phosphoric acid (pH 4.7) is formed 
- **Triclopyr** (herbicide) must be below 2 ppb, or it could be toxic to aquatic organisms 
	- Small organisms (like daphnia) that ingest small amounts of it are unharmed, but the substance remains in their body for å long time and organisms who eat a lot these fish could intake a harmful dose 

## Important organisms 
There are many organisms in an ecosystem. Here are the most important ones to keep note of. 

### [[Pasted Image 20220528194033_261.png|Largemouth bass]] 
- Habitat: shallow lakes, ponds, or rivers 
- Size: adults can range from 26 to 46 cm 
- Diets: 
	- Young: daphnia, gammarus amphipods, and invertebrates 
	- Adults: small fish (ex. bluegill), frogs, and aquatic invertebrates 
- Ecological importance: 
	- Maintains population size of other species as a predator 

### [[white bass.png|White bass]] 
- Habitat: deep, clear lakes and large rivers 
- Size: adults can range from 38 to 50 cm 
- Diet: ==mostly daphnia== 
	- This could explain why the white bass population was least effected by spike in triclopyr concentration 
- Reproduction: white bass can only spawn in water ranging from 12 to 20 °C 
- Ecological importance: 
	- Maintains population size of other species as a predator 

### [[white bass.png|Bluegill]] 
- Habitat: weedy, shallow, waters 
	- Intolerance to high turbulence 
- Size: adults can range from 15 to 35 cm 
- Diet: Daphnia, gammarus amphipods, insects, and crustaceans 
- Ecological importance: 
	- Important aquatic predators 
	- Provide food for larger fish 
		- Numerous organisms eat their eggs 
	- ==Largemouth bass can eat bluegill== 

### [[daphnia.png|Daphnia]] 
- Habitat: lakes below 20 degrees Celsius 
- Size: 1 mm 
- Diet: Bacteria, protists, algae 
- **Ecological importance**
	- Major source of food for fish (95% of a fish’s stomach can be just daphnia) 
		- *Largemouth bass, white bass, and bluegill all eat daphnia*
	- Helps maintain water quality by ==cleaning up algae blooms== 

### [[Gammarus amphipod.png|Gammarus amphipod]]
- Habitat: well-oxygenated floors of ==lakes and rivers (<20 °C)== 
- Size: 21 mm 
- Diet: ==Algae== and dead organic matter 
- Ecological importance: 
	- Main source of food for larger freshwater organisms 
	- Sensitive to changes in the environment 
		- ex. ==low pH levels or warm temperatures== 

### [[algae.png|Algae]] 
- Habitat: wherever there is a body of water of a sufficient quantity of moisture 
- Size: can live as single cells, in colonies, or within filaments 
- Ecological importance: 
	- Too high concentrations of nitrates and phosphate increases algae population 
		- This can lead to an algal bloom 
	- ==Many of the algae begin to die off as the population increases== 
	- This increases the number of decomposer bacteria, which use up too much of the oxygen levels in the lake, suffocating fish 

### [[Pickerelweed.png|Pickerelweed]]
- Habitat: lakes, ponds, ditches, and streams 
- Size: 60 to 90 cm tall 
- Ecological importance: 
	- Provide habitats for many invertebrates 
	- Invertebrates also feed on decomposed aquatic plants 

### [[Hydrilla.png|Hydrilla]] 
- **Invasive species** 
- Habitat: lakes, ponds, ditches, and streams 
- Size: up to 760 cm tall 
- Ecological importance: 
	- Dense strands can: 
		- Prevent light from penetrating to deeper water 
		- Reduce dissolved oxygen 
		- Displace native plants and reduce biodiversity 

### [[water hyacinth.png|Water hyacinth]] 
- **Invasive species** 
- Habitat: lakes, ponds, ditches, and streams; floats above the water surface 
- Size: leaves are 10 to 20 cm and can be up to 1 m above the surface 
- Ecological importance: 
	- Water hyacinth can cover entire lakes and ponds 
		- This blocks sunlight from reaching into the lake 
		- Starves the water of oxygen 
	- Provides perfect habitat for mosquitoes 

## Food web

![[Food web of Lake Grace 2022-05-28 19.38.32.excalidraw|700]]

**Nitrate - more algae - more algae with tri is eaten - more daphnia with tri - more sportfish with tri + higher tri doses**
