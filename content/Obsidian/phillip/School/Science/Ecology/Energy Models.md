- Describe how energy moves through an ecosystem 
- Understand the significance of producers in an ecosystem 

## 4 types of energy models 
### Food chain

- Shows how energy moves through an ecosystem 
- Shows **linear relationship** 
- Limited in its range 
	- Useful for focusing on a specific chain, as it does not encompass the entire ecosystem 
>**Note: arrows move towards the consumer**  
>ex. fly $\rightarrow$ frog $\rightarrow$ snake $\rightarrow$ bird 



### Food Web

- Intertwined food chains 
- Shows [[13.2 Abiotic and Biotic Factors#Biodiversity|biodiversity]] 
	- Shows all different predator-prey relationships in an ecosystem 
	- More biodiversity $\rightarrow$ more sustainable ecosystem 
- Complicated, yet total 

### Energy Pyramid

- Shows the **distribution of energy among trophic levels** 
- Units of energy 
	- Calories, kilocalories 
	- Joules 
- Only around 10% of the energy in a [[Trophic Level]] is stored in the next trophic level 
	- 10% of all the energy an organism intakes is stored in its body 
	- So only 10% is carried on to the next trophic level 
	- The rest of the energy is used by keeping the organism alive 
- Tropic level 1 would have the most energy, then the second level, etc.

### Biomass pyramid

- Shows **the distribution of  [[biomass]]** of an ecosystem 
- Similar to energy pyramid, but mass not energy 
>**Note: biomass pyramids can be inverted**
