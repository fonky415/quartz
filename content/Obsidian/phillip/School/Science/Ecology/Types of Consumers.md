# Types of Consumers 
Created: 2022-04-26 14:31

Scientists categorize consumers into 5 main categories. Each are different in what they consume. Note that these categories aren't choices, meaning that vegans, who chose to only eat plants, are not herbivores. If an organism can digest it, they can eat it. 

## Herbivores 
- Organisms that can only eat plants 

## Carnivores 
- Organisms that can only eat animals  

## Omnivores 
- Organisms that can eat both plants and animals 

## Detritivores  
- Organisms that eat detritus (dead organic matter)
	- ex. millipedes, beetles. etc. 

## Decomposers 
- Organisms that further break down organic matter 
- Return nutrients back to the environment 

Consumers can also either be specialist or generalist. 

## Specialist 
- Picky eater 
- Only eats smaller variety of organisms 

## Generalist 
- Consumers with a wide variety of food 
- Most organisms are generalist so that they are not dependent on one food source
