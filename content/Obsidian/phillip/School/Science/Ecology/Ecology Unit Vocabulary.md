# Ecology Unit Vocabulary (for lab) 
Created: 2022-06-08 08:06  

List of all the vocabulary terms relevant to just this lab, not necessarily the entire unit. 

# Population 

[[Carrying capacity]]
>“The increase in nitrate concentration increased the amount of algae, which in turn increased the daphnia population, as daphina consume the algae. Thus, the dump of the nitrates from the hog farm increased the *carrying capacity* of daphnia.”

> [!important]
[[Population Crash]]
>>“With the daphnia contaminated with triclopyr and the algae population drastically reduced also due to the herbicide, the daphnia population greatly reduced, causing a *population crash* in the entire ecosystem.”

[[Density-Independent Limiting Factors]]
>The increase in nitrate and triclopyr was not nature’s doing–it was human activities that resulted in the increase in nitrate and triclopyr. These limiting factors are *density-independent limiting factors*, as the humans don’t care about the organisms in the lake. 

[[Density-Dependent Limiting Factors]]
>One *density-dependent limiting factor* is competition for food. As the population increases, the competition for food naturally increases, which limits the population. 

[[13.2 Abiotic and Biotic Factors#Biotic|Biotic factors]]
>The most prominent *biotic factor* in Lake Grace is algae, as they are the producers of the ecosystem. More algae will increase the population, and a fewer algae population will decrease it. 

[[13.2 Abiotic and Biotic Factors#Abiotic|Abiotic factors]]
>The main reason why the sports fish population decreased was because of an *abiotic factor*–the implementation of herbicides by human intervention. The herbicide, composed of harmful substances, such as triclopyr, caused the ecosystem to collapse. 

[[13.2 Abiotic and Biotic Factors#^c90447|Approximate equilibrium]]
>In a healthy ecosystem, there must be an *approximate equilibrium* to keep the balance between the population of different organisms stable. If one increases or decreases by a drastic degree, however, an ecosystem may collapse completely to the point where it cannot recover. 

[[Biodiversity]]
>One reason why the sudden increase in triclopyr concentration in Lake Grace was so detrimental to the entire ecosystem could have been the lack in *biodiversity* in the lake. The sportfish’s diet relied too much on one organism, daphina, which eventually led to its downfall. 

## Roles in the ecosystem 

> [!important]
[[Keystone species]]
>>The *keystone species* in Lake Grace could be identified as daphnia, as the three sportfish’s diet was heavily comprised of daphina. 

[[13.3 Energy in Ecosystems#Producers|Producers]]
>Algae proved to have a significant impact on the ecosystem, especially after the increase in nitrate concentration. As a *producer,* it consumed a lot of the nitrate and grew rapidly. 

[[13.3 Energy in Ecosystems#Consumers|Consumers]]
>The *consumers* consumed a lot of triclopyr that would concentrate more and more until it gets to a lethal level at the top of the biomass pyramid. 

[[Types of Consumers#Omnivores|Omnivores]]
>The 

[[Types of Consumers#Specialist|Specialist]]
>The three sportfish are *specialists,* meaning that their diet is not very diversified. This leads them to heavily rely on one or two organisms in the ecosystem for their primary source of food. If that primary source of food is contaminated or greatly reduced in population (which is what happened), the specialists will have a hard time surviving. 

[[14.2 Community Interactions#Competition|Competition]]
>As the food source for the sportfish decreased, there was much higher *competition* for food, resulting in a decrease in population. 

# Biomass model 

[[Biomass]]
>Because the sportfish, being in the top trophic level of the ecosystem, has the least *biomass* in the ecosystem, the triclopyr concentration was highest there. This is because as the solvent (sportfish) decreases, the concentration of the solute (triclopyr) increases. 

[[Trophic Level]]
>As the sportfish are at the upmost *trophic level*, the concentration of triclopyr was highest for them, eventually leading to the decrease in their population. 

[[Energy Models#^b1638b|Biomass pyramid]]
>The *biomass pyramid* allows the visualization of biomagnification, as the amount of biomass decreases significantly as you go further up the biomass pyramid. 

[[16.3 Water Quality#Accumulation of toxins in the food chain|Biomagnification]]
>As the amount of biomass decreases the further you go up the biomass pyramid but the amount of triclopyr barely decreases, the concentration of triclopyr increases–this is a prime example of *biomagnification*.
