**:type of air pollution caused by the interaction of sunlight with pollutants produced by fossil fuel emissions** 

## Two main components: particulate matter and ground-level ozone 

### Particulates 
- Microscopic bits of dust, metal, and unburned fuel 
- 1-10 microns in size 
- Can stay in the air for weeks before they settle to the ground 
- Can be inhaled and cause health issues 

### Ground-level ozone 
- When nitrogen dioxide ($NO_2$) reacts with oxygen ($O_2)$ with sunlight, ozone ($O_3$) is formed 
- This ozone tends to stay close to the ground 
- Can be harmful for organisms and ecosystems
