# Chemistry 

:the study of the **composition**, **structure**, and **properties** of matter, the **processes** that matter undergoes, and the **energy changes** that accompany these processes. 

*What is a material’s makeup? How does a material change when heated, cooled, or mixed with other materials and why does this behavior occur?* 

## Branches of Chemistry 
There are many branches of this area of study. Here are the major ones in no particular order. 

**Organic chemistry** 
the study of most carbon-containing compounds

**Inorganic chemistry**
the study of non-organic substances, many of which have organic fragments bonded to metals (organometallics)

**Physical chemistry** 
the study of the properties and changes of matter and their relation to energy

**Analytical chemistry** 
the identification of the components and composition of materials

**Biochemistry** 
the study of substances and processes occurring in living things

**Theoretical chemistry**
the use of mathematics and computers to understand the principles behind observed chemical behavior and to design and predict the properties of new compounds 

>You can’t forget [[chemical|chemicals]] when talking about chemistry. 

## Basic Research vs Applied Research 
Basic research is research done for the sake of science: curiousity. Through basic research, chance discoveries are sometimes made, like Teflon. 

Applied research is research done for a specific problem or goal, whether that is environmental, economic, and more.
