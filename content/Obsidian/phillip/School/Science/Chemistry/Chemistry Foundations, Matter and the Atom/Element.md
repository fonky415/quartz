# Element 
A pure substance that cannot be broken down into simpler, stable substances and is made of one type of atom. 

>[!Example] Example 
>Carbon, iron, [[copper]], etc.

## Periodic table of elements

### Groups/families 
The vertical columns of the periodic table are called groups or families. Groups contain elements similar to each other, as each element of a group has the same number of valence electrons, which are the electrons on the outermost shell.

### Periods 
The horizontal rows are called periods. Generally, the closer elements are next to each other, the more similar in their properties they are. [More info](https://periodictableguide.com/periods-in-periodic-table/)

### Metals 
Metals *can* conduct electricity and heat well. 

#### Properties 
- Malleability 
	- Can be hammered or rolled into thin sheets 
- Ductile 
	- Can be drawn into a fine wire 
- High tensile strength 
	- Resistence to being pulled 
- Most have a silvery or grayish white luster 

### Nonmetals 
Nonmetals *cannot* conduct electricty and heat well. There are fewer nonmetals than metals. 

#### Noble gas 
Noble gases are a type of nonmetal that are very unreactive. 

### Metalloid 
Metalloids, found between metals and nonmetals, are elements that have characteristics from both metals and nonmetals. They are used as semiconductors of electricity.
