# Pure Substance 
A pure substance has a **uniform composition** throughout the entire sample–homogeneous. It cannot be seperated by physical means, as they are either [[compound|compounds]] or [[Element|elements]].

## 2 key differneces from a [[mixture]] 
1. *Properties are [[Extensive properties|extensive]].* The amount of the pure substance doesn’t change its [[Physical property|physical]] and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]], so every sample of the pure substance has the exact same properties. 
2. *Every sample of a pure substance has exactly the same composition.* Not only are the properties always the same, but the composition is also always the same. For example, pure water is always 11.2% hydrogen and 88.8% oxygen.

## Impurities 
Not all pure substances are equally pure. Here are some chemical purity grades:
