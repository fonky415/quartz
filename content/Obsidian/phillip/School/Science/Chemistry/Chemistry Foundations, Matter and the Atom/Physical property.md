Changing the substance without changing the identity of the substance is called a **physical change.** (Opposite of [[Chemical Change]]) ^b7475d

>[!EXAMPLE] Example
>I can cut wood and shave it, but the leftover is still wood.

A **change of state**, which is also a physical change, specifically concerns change in the [[States of Matter|state of the matter]] (solid, liquid, gas, etc.). **A change of state does not change the identity of the substance.** Ice and water vapor is, at the end of the day, still water.
