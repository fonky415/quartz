# Mixture 
A combination of two or more substances that are not chemically bound. A mixture is physically mixed, so it can usually be separated. 

Examples: 
- Sugar and water 
- Salt and water 
- Air (mixture of gases) 
- Salt and sugar 
- Sand and water 

## Properties 
The properties of a mixture is a **combination of the properties of its components.** To know its properties more accurately, scientists determine what percentage of each component is in the mixture. 

## Consistency of mixture 
There is another subcategory of mixtures: homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures.

### Homogeneous mixture 
Also known as a solution, a homogeneous mixture is when the distribution of the components of the mixture is consistent throughout the entire mixture, with the **components indistinguishable from each other**. Examples include saltwater, sugar water, blood, coffee, and air. 

### Heterogeneous mixture 
Mixtures that are not uniform throughout is called a heterogeneous mixture. Examples include a pizza, cereal, sand and water, and oil and water. 

## Separating mixtures
There are many methods in separating mixtures, but here are the main ones.

### Filtration 
Pretty simple. A filter paper can allow small particles to go through, but bigger ones get stuck on it. 

### Centrifuge 
The centrifuge spins quickly and makes the solid go to the bottom and liquid on top. Blood is separated using this method. 

### Chromatography 
Mixtures of dyes or pigments can also be separated using paper chromatography, as the different substances move at different rates on the paper.
