# Media Democracy 

Media democracy advocates for a world where all media is democratic–there shouldn’t be too much regulation or private ownership of media. Information should be distributed more equally, and the range of information should be cosmopolitan and expansive. 

## Media and the public sphere 
- No filtering should go through the media to the public 
- The democracy of the public sphere with its free communication and right to voice virtually any opinion relies on free media for the public to have information to share
