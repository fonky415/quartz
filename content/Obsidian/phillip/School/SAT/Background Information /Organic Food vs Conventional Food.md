# Organic Food vs Conventional Food 

**Before more efficient and eco-friendly alternatives to farming are developed, farmers should consider integrating both organic and conventional methods of farming.** 

## Agriculture’s impact on the environment 
- Agriculture has depleted much of the world’s land and resources 
	- 70% of grasslands gone 
	- 50% of savannas gone 
	- 45% of temperate forests gone 
- Farming is leading cause of deforestation 
- Pollution 
	- One of the largest sources of greenhouse gases 
	- Water contamination 

## Potential solution? Organic food 
- Farming without the use of artificial methods ex.:
	- synthetic fertilizer 
	- chemical pesticides 
	- chemical horomones 
	- antibiotic treatment 

### It can sustain the environment, but can it sustain the perennial human population? 
- Maybe, but it produces less than convential farming. 
- Overall, organic farming produces less crops 
- There is only 5% difference in rain-watered legume crops and perennial crops, but for cereal crops, conventional farming is 25% more efficient 
- This is due to the limit in nitrogen for organic farming 

## The main problem is that food isn’t being distributed. 
- The world produces more calories than needed for the entire human population 
- The problem is that that food is not distributed equally and is being wasted 

McGill's Verena Seufert notes, 
>[!Cite] Given the current precarious situation of agriculture, we should assess many alternative management systems, including conventional, organic, other agro-ecological and possibly hybrid systems to identify the best options to improve the way we produce our food.
