# Act 4 Summary 
Created: 2022-05-11 10:26  

Juliet takes the vial and “dies.” That's the most important part of it. Shakespeare really stretched this out into a whole act. 

## Scene 1 : Juliet takes the vial 
- [[Juliet]] considers suicide to not have to marry [[Paris]] 
- [[Friar Lawrence]] proposes a [[Act 4 Scene 1#^850572|solution]]: fake her death for 48 hours and escape to Mantua 
- Juliet accepts 

## Scene 2: Preparation for wedding 
- The Capulets are busy preparing themselves for the wedding on Thursday 

## Scene 3: Juliet drinks the vial 
- After Juliet think about all the horrible things that could happen to her in the tomb, she reminds herself of [[Romeo]] and drinks the vial 

## Scene 4: Final preparations for wedding 
- [[Lord Capulet]] checks to see how everyone is doing 
- At the end of the scene, he tells the [[Nurse]] to wake up Juliet 

## Scene 5: Juliet is “dead” 
- One by one, everyone finds out that Juliet is still and cold 
- The wedding turns into a funeral 

## Discussion questions 
1. Are Juliet's actions in Act 4 a display of bravery or foolish ignorance? 
2. What emotions from Friar Lawrence motivate him to help Romeo and Juliet? 
4. Why does Shakespeare add the small scene with the musicians at the end of Act 4? 
5. Does Friar Lawrence still want the best for Romeo and Juliet? 
6. Does Lady Capulet still love Juliet?
