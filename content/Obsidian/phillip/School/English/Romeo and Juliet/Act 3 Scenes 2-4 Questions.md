My beloved English teacher, Ms. Charrier, gave us these questions to answer for homework. Oh, how much fun I will have reading more about Shakespeare and getting to learn more about Romeo and Juliet. 

## [[Act 3 Scene 2]] 

**1. Juliet’s monologue [[Act 3 Scene 2#^7ab2b8|lines 1-35]]–what devices reveal Juliet’s thoughts and feelings?**  
	[[Juliet]] uses a metaphor in lines 28 to 31, saying that she's "an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them" right before a holiday. She also says love is blind, which is personifying love. 

**2.  What is the confusion and misunderstanding between Juliet and the Nurse’s in lines 36-72?**  
	The [[Nurse]] first said that "he" died. She was referring to [[Tybalt]], but Juliet thought that the Nurse was talking about [[Romeo]]. 

**3. What devices or ideas in Juliet’s speech in [[Act 3 Scene 2#^9142af|lines 74-86]] mirror Romeo’s in [[Act 1 Scene 1]]?**  
	Juliet uses oxymora to describe the two sides of Romeo she loves and hates. Romeo does a similar thing when talking about his love for [[Rosaline]] in Act 1 Scene 1. 

**4. How does Juliet’s language in [[Act 3 Scene 2#^41ee98|lines 98-128]] reveal inner conflict, and how does she resolve it?**  
	The manner Juliet questions herself with how to justify Romeo and how this situation is actually good shows her inner conflict between Romeo and her family. Her reasoning is that Tybalt had tried to kill Romeo, but Romeo was able to kill him in a duel. She then concentrates on the fact that Romeo is banished and explains how that is worse than anything else that could happen. (Such as their entire family dying.)

**5. What is the significance of the “cord” and “ring” in this scene? What literary element are they?**  
	Both are symbols. The cord represents Romeo's physical connection with Juliet, as that is what Romeo must use to get to Juliet's room. The ring represents their emotional connection, as something no physical boundary can block. The ring can also symbolize the infinite love between them. 

## [[Act 3 Scene 3]]

**6. How does Romeo use logic to equate “banishment” and “death” in [[Act 3 Scene 3#^e72599|lines 17-20]]? How does his statement in [[Act 3 Scene 3#^2550d8|lines 12-14]] mirror what he said to Juliet in [[Act 2 Scene 2]]?** 
	His status in Verona as the son of a nobleman only exists within the walls of Verona. Therefore, outside the walls, or his world, his name is worthless and is just like any other man and is out of his world. To Romeo, he can't bear to live in the "purgatory, torture, hell itself," so his banishment equals death. His statement in lines 12-24 are similar to what he said in [[Act 2 Scene 2#^4f1346|lines 75-78]] in Act 2 Scene 2. In Act 2 Scene 2, he says how he would rather be killed than not live where Juliet is. 
    
**7. What devices does Romeo use to illustrate how terrible he thinks banishment is in [[Act 3 Scene 3#^8043d3|lines 29-51]]?**  
	Romeo is juxtaposing himself with the fly. Romeo uses thrid person here possibly to show that he doesn't want to be Romeo. 

**8. How do Romeo’s [[Act 3 Scene 3#^45b2f5|lines 102-108]] mirror his interaction with Juliet in Act 2 Scene 2?**  
	The idea of the separation of someone and their name is repeated by Romeo trying to literally cut it out with a dagger. In act 2, it was romantic, but here, it is more desperate. 
	    
**9. Examine [[Act 3 Scene 3#^e5e9bf|Friar Lawrence’s advice]] to Romeo on page 177-179. What is he saying to him?**  
	[[Friar Lawrence]] is saying that Romeo should be grateful for so many things that happened and didn't happen, and that killing himself is just as the same as killing Juliet. Friar Lawrence tells him to continue the plan of making peace between the families and gives Romeo hope to his life. What a speech. 

## [[Act 3 Scene 4]]

**10. What day is it? What has happened in the past 24 hours?** 
	It's Monday. All of this happened in 24 hours: Romeo and Juliet fall in love, marry, Tybaly dies, Romeo is banished from Verona, and Romeo sneaks into Juliet's room. What a day. (or two days)

**11.  What decision does Capulet make, and how does this represent the “falling action” of the play?** 
	[[Lord Capulet|Capulet]] decides to marry his daughter, Juliet, to Paris on Thursday, which is just 3 days away. This represents the "falling action," as the story starts to come to an end with Juliet and Paris's marriage that was mentioned in Act 1 actually happening. Everything is falling apart.
