>**MERCUTIO**

>**ROMEO**  
Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes 
With nimble sales. I have a soul of lead  
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

>**MERCUTIO**  
You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings  
And soar with them above a common bound.

>**ROMEO**  
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft  
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound, 
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe. 
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
