**Directions:**
You will write a refutation of the given claim. Be sure to acknowledge its validity before posing your alternative claim. Then, write a paragraph in response to support your own claim, using the paragraph structure taught in class, with TWO supporting assertions, and TWO pieces of proof, with explanations, to support your claim. This is a paragraph, not an essay. Respond on the doc provided in Google Classroom, using the outline.

**Acknowledge Counterclaim:**  
One might argue that Capulet is primarily motivated by the “ancient grudge” between his family and the Montague family from their conflict in Act 1, Scene 1. 

**Refute Counterclaim & Present your Claim** 
Although Capulet does have a grudge with the Montague, most of his actions aren’t for the “ancient grudge” but to keep his personal reputation. 

**Transition and Assertion 1:** 
Such motivation for reputation can be shown through Capulet and Paris’ conversation in the beginning of Act 1 Scene 2. 

**Context and Proof 1:** 
Capulet says to Paris that “'tis not hard[…] to keep the peace” and agrees to do so. (1.2.2) Later, he seems reluctant to marry his daughter, Juliet, to Paris, and wants Paris to wait a couple of years before he marries Juliet. “Let two more summers wither in their pride Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.” (1.2.10) 

**Explanation 1:** 
Here, Capulet’s line of reasoning is that if he agrees to do what Paris asks of him, which is to keep peace with Montague, Paris will listen to Capulet and consider other women and not just Juliet. This shows that Capulet’s care for his daughter is above his “ancient grudge” against Montague. 

**Transition and Assertion 2:**  
Also during the party in Scene 5, Capulet’s motivations to keep his personal reputation clean can be seen. 

**Context and evidence 2:**  
When Tybalt notices that Romeo snuck into the party, Tybalt asks one his page for his sword, so that he can kill Romeo. When Capulet learns of this, he tells his nephew to be patient. Take no note of him. It is my will, the which if thou respect, Show a fair presence and put off these frowns, An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.” (1.5.63) 

**Explanation 2:**  
If Capulet really was driven purely by his grudge against the Montague, he would’ve had no problem having Tybalt kill Romeo. Capulet, however, doesn’t hate Romeo at all, but calls him a “portly gentleman” and a “virtuous and well-governed youth.” (1.5.64) He explains to Tybalt that he doesn’t want to “make a mutiny among my guests,” (1.5.78) most likely because he doesn’t want to ruin his reputation in front of all the guests. 

**Concluding statement:**
Capulet definitely has a grudge against the Montague family, but this “ancient grudge” is more oral than physical. Instead, Capulet’s main motivation is to make sure his reputation is well-respected.
