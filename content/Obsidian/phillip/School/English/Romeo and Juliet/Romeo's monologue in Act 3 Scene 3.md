Created: 2022-05-26 16:45  

This is a modern translation of the [[Act 3 Scene 3#^8043d3|monologue]] (3.3.29~51)

>흥분하면서 갑자기 stop speeding up and raising volume and pause here 

And yet you say that exile is *not death*? Did you have no *poison*, no *sharp knife*, no *weapon* you could use to kill me quickly, nothing so disgraceful, except **banishment**? Oh Friar, *damned souls* use the word **banishment** to describe *hell*. They *howl* about **banishment**.

>sadness 200%
