# Poetic Devices
Tags: #Reference #poetry 

"Poetic devices are a form of literary device used in poetry. Poems are created out of poetic devices composite of: structural, grammatical, rhythmic, metrical, verbal, and visual elements. They are essential tools that a poet uses to **create rhythm, enhance a poem's meaning, or intensify a mood or feeling**."

## Sound 
Especially for poems meant to be spoken out loud, poetic devices that change how it's said can deliver the mood of the poem effectively. 

**Cacophony**
a series of harsh words with lots of consonants, makes them difficult to pronounce, creates confusion and discomfort 
	(ex. [“Beware the Jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! The frumious Bandersnatch!” This excerpt from Lewis Carroll's “Jabberwocky” is perhaps the most famous example of cacophony with harsh and loud sounds in invented words like “brillig,” “gimble,” “borogoves,” and “Jugjub”!](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwidnb6Gn_n2AhWZxYsBHVm9DEsQFnoECA0QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fliteraryterms.net%2Fcacophony%2F&usg=AOvVaw0UPwXd4szZ2s3QH2u0uADK))

**Euphony** 
a series of soft words with lots of long vowels, making them soothing to listen to 
	(ex. [An example of euphony is the end of Shakespeare's famous "Sonnet 18," which goes "So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, / So long lives this, and this gives life to thee." ](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjXltaYuvn2AhVoUfUHHecPBo0QFnoECA4QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.litcharts.com%2Fliterary-devices-and-terms%2Feuphony&usg=AOvVaw0__aZFc_C-Li1BufYERXgP))

**Alliteration and Assonance** 
repetition of a specific sound can create or enhance a mood 
alliteration: repetition of consonants  
assonance: vowels 
	(ex. Barry the bunny badly broke Bruno's backbone. "O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?" )

**Meter** 
a pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables 

## Structure 
A pattern the poem follows, or a lack of it, can help deliver a message or strengthen one to the reader. 

#### Two types:
==Regular structure==
- All lines & stanzas the same length 
- Punctuation/pauses at the end of lines 
	$\Rightarrow$ Creates *continuity and simplicity*, or can seem stifling, overly restrictive (ex. [[sonnets]])

==Irregular structure== 
- Lines of different lengths 
- Lines which do not end in pauses ([[enjambment]]) 
- Lines with pauses in the middle of them ([[caesura]])
- No stanzas 
	$\Rightarrow$ creates *chaos and uncertainty*, or can connote freedom and wildness

**Repetition** 
when a word or phrase is repeated for emphasis 
	ex. Maya Angelou's "[[Still I Rise]]" 

![[Still I Rise#^c2066f]]

**Rhyme Scheme**
the pattern of rhyming words at the end of each line (ex. ABCA, ABABCDCDEFEFGG)

**Internal Rhyme**
words that rhyme not at the end of the sentence but before 
	(ex. "Once upon a midnight *dreary*, while I pondered, weak and *weary*,
	Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
	While I nodded, nearly *napping*, suddenly there came a *tapping*,
	As of someone gently *rapping*, *rapping* at my chamber door. 
	'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, '*tapping* at my chamber door;
	Only this, and nothing more.'") - Edgar Alan Poe from "The Raven"

**Form**
The genre, or type of poem - the way the poem is written according to conventions 

## Figurative Language 
Every word choice a poet makes is most likely intentional, so one must consider the specific diction the author uses very carefully. 

**Imagery**
description which appeals to the senses (sight, sound, hearing, smell, touch, taste) 

**Emotive language**
different words might have similar meanings but different connotations 
	(ex. “energetic” $\rightarrow$ positive or “unfocused” $\rightarrow$ negative) 

**Contrast** 
putting two or more things with very different connotations next to each other to highlight their differences (aka. juxtaposition), or reveal an unexpected similarity 
	(ex. Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. / Do not go gentle into that good night. / Rage, rage against the dying of the light. / Do not Go Gentle into that. [[Good Night]] by Thomas Dylan) contrasting death against life 


Oxymoron is when a noun is paired with an adjective with an opposite meaning.
