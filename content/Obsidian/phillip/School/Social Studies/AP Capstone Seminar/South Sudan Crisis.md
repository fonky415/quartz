## Aftermath of the war 
The war had drastic effects on many parts of South Sudan, causing multiple human rights to be neglected. 

### Education 
- Increased spending on military and less on education 
- “According to a United Nations report, **50 percent of Sudanese children do not attend school.**” 
- Schoolchildren are **abducted by soldiers** and **forced to join the military** or armed rebel groups 
- Most girls are then **raped by their captors** and those who resist are killed 
- Boys are “castrated and sexually mutilated” 
- According to a United Nations report, an estimated 430 children were **victims of sexual violence through military recruitment.** ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sudanese_Civil_War#Education))

>[!WARNING] HR Violations 
>**Article 26** (right to education) and **Article 5** (Torture and Degrading Treatment) are just two of the many human rights that are being violated. 

### Women’s rights 
- Sexual inequality 
- Now fighting for “‘sexual and gender-based abuse’, education, healthcare, and ‘access to law and justice.’” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sudanese_Civil_War#Women's_experience))
- “[…]45% of girls married before their 18th birthday (and 7% married before they turned 15). These rates have increased since the start of the conflict.” ([ConcernUSA](https://www.concernusa.org/story/south-sudan-crisis-explained/))
- “[…]a recent survey showed that 82% of women and 81% of men agreed that ‘women should tolerate domestic violence in order to keep their families together.’[…]one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world at 14%.” ([ConcernUSA](https://www.concernusa.org/story/south-sudan-crisis-explained/))

### Hunger Crisis 
- Conflict has reduced harvests and amount of food 
- This increases stealing, which then increases conflict 
- COVID-19 exacerbates whole situation 

#### Statistics 
- “Of the 12.4 million people living in South Sudan, **8.9 million require humanitarian assistance**, with **7.7 million facing severe food insecurity** (IPC 3 and above), meaning that over **60 percent** of the population is struggling to put enough food on the table regularly.” (emp. added.) Source: ([WFP](https://www.wfp.org/publications/South-Sudan))
- “At least **87,000 people are already experiencing famine-like conditions** (IPC 5), and **2.9 million others are just one step from catastrophe** (IPC 4 – Emergency). In 2022, there is already a 36 percent increase in admissions to the treatment of acute malnutrition programmes, and over **one-third of the counties in south Sudan have Global Acute Malnutrition** (GAM) rates that exceed the emergency threshold of 15 percent.” (emp. added.)
