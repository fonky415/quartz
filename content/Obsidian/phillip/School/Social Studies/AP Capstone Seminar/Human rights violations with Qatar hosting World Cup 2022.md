# Human rights violations with Qatar hosting World Cup 2022 

Violation of Article 25. 

## Background information 
- The 2022 FIFA World Cup is planned to start on 21 November in Qatar
- “Building seven stadiums for the finals, a new airport, new metro and new roads” ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60867042))
- Qatar is a conservative Muslim country and [same-sex relationships are illegal](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-43822234). ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60867042))
- First one ever to be held in the Middle East 
- Much controversy even before building the stadium 
	- Although the FIFA internal investigation didn’t find anything, there are allegations of corruption and money laundering in Qatar’s 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids ([ESPN](https://www.espn.com/soccer/fifa-world-cup/story/2468298/criminal-investigation-begins-into-)) 

The following snippets are from [this BBC article](https://redactionpolitics.com/2022/07/26/qatars-world-cup-2022-amnesty-human-rights/).

## How has Qatar treated stadium workers? 
### Even after government measures, not well. 
>[!Cite] However, campaign group Human Rights Watch said in a [2021 report](https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/08/24/how-can-we-work-without-wages/salary-abuses-facing-migrant-workers-ahead-qatars) that foreign workers were still suffering from “punitive and illegal wage deductions”, as well as “months of unpaid wages for long hours of gruelling work.”

### What do the numbers say, and are they accurate? 
>[!Cite] In February 2021, the Guardian said 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka [had died in Qatar since it won its World Cup bid.](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/23/revealed-migrant-worker-deaths-qatar-fifa-world-cup-2022) […] Qatar says that between 2014 and 2020, [there were 37 deaths](https://www.workerswelfare.qa/sites/default/files/reports_item/field_document/sixth-annual-workers-welfare-progress-report-december-2020-en.pdf) among labourers building World Cup stadiums. It [International Labour Organization (ILO)] says 34 of those were "non-work related". […] It says [50 workers died and more than 500 others were seriously injured in Qatar in 2021 alone,](https://www.ilo.org/beirut/projects/qatar-office/WCMS_828399/lang--en/index.htm) and another 37,600 suffered mild to moderate injuries.

>[!Cite] Qatar's government says the figures are an overestimate, because they include thousands of foreigners who died after living and working there for many years. It says many would have been working in jobs unrelated to the building industry.

## Is Qatar safe for LGBT people? 
### Unclear. 
>[!Cite] Qatar World Cup organisers have previously said everyone is welcome, but "[public displays of affection in general, for homosexuals and non-homosexuals, are not part of our tradition."](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/24077188)
