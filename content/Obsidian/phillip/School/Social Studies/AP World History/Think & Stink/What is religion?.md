# What is religion? 

Religion is simply a set of practices or beliefs. A religion may or may not contain a god-like being. Most religions offer an explanation of the universe and the purpose of it, and often have an afterlife. 

Could I start a religion? Sure, why not? I donâ€™t think a religion necessarily needs many followers to become one. Heck, I could be its sole believer and it could be my own religion. The line between religion and philosophy is hazy, but I would say that religion has a God while philosophies don't.
