# The Influence of Indian Society in Southeast Asia 
India was like China to Asia, but to south and southeast Asia. Rich of political and cultural traditions, countless southeast Asian cultures adapted from Indian society. All this happened without Indian troops having to invade other lands, thanks to merchants. 

## The States of Southeast Asia 
- Indian merchants came to southeast Asia as early as 500 B.C.E. 
- Native rulers in southeast Asia traded exotic products (pearls, aromatics, animal skins) for textiles, beads, gold, silver, metals, political/religious objects, etc. to consolidate power 
- **Through this trading, southeast Asian elites borrowed Indian political and cultural traditions** 
	- Political 
		- Kingship 
	- Religious 
		- Hinduism 
		- Buddhism 
	- Literature 
		- *Ramayana* 
		- *Mahabharata* 
	- Caste system wasn’t very popular 
- Similarities & differences 
	- Funan and Angkor: land-based states 
		- Most of their wealth came from agriculture 
	- Srivijaya, Singosari, and Majapahit: island-based states 
		- Most of their wealth came from water trade 
	- Funan and Majapahit → Hindu 
	- Srivijaya and Angkor → Budhism

## The Arrival of Islam 
Islam came to India first through Muslim merchants and invasions. Through India was Islam able to spread throughout the rest of southeast Asia, as well as Hinduism and Buddhism. 

### Conversion to Islam 
- Islam was first quietly practiced by Muslim merchants in the port cities 
- As time passed, other people who interacted with these Muslim merchants knew about Islam and the idea spread 
- The conversion to Islam wasn’t absolute 
	- Elites still continued to practice past religions, but incorporated a little bit of Islam into it for better relations with foriegn Muslims 
	- Sufis too didn’t reject religions that weren’t Islamic, but integrated Islamic aspects into preexisting beliefs
