# The Meeting of Hindu and Islamic Traditions 
- By 1000 C.E., Jainism and Buddhism lost most of their followers 
- Hinduism and Islam took over 
- Two very different religions 
- South → Hinduism 
- North → Islam 

## The Development of Hinduism 
### Fall of Buddhism 
- Buddhism flourished at the end of 1000 C.E. in most parts of Asia except India 
- Both Hinduism and Islam promised salvation like Mahayana Buddhism 
- Conquerors destroyed Buddhist stupas and shrines 
	- Muslim forces destroyed the city of Nalanda in 1196 and destroyed schools, libraries, monks, everything 

>[!NOTE] Buddhism died… where it was born.

### Vishnu and Shiva

- Growth in popularity of devotional cults for Vishnu and Shiva benefited Hinduism 
- **Vishnu**  ^26a7d2
	- Preserver of the world 
	- A god who watched the Earth from heaven and sometimes came down to fight evil or preach 
- **Shiva**  ^b533cd
	- God of fertility and destruction 
- These devotional cults became especially popular in the south 
- More and more temples and shrines got built 

### Influence on philosophers

- **Shankara**  ^6dafd9
	- Worshiped Shiva 
	- Shankara read the Upanishads (oldest scriptures of Hinduism) and went all philosophical 
	- Said that the physical world is an illusion 
- **Ramanujan**  ^7a3f5d
	- Worshiped Vishnu 
	- Challenged Shankara’s ideas 
	- Basically saying that figuring out reality doesn’t matter; all that really matters is having salvation from the gods 

## Islam and Its Appeal 
- **At first, [[Islam]] was not popular** 
	- Invaders brought Islam with violence 
	- Only place where Islam was followed were in the families of the Muslim merchants 
	- Conquerors also had little incentive to convert Indians to Muslims 
- **After some time, more Indians started converting**: 1500 C.E. → 25 million Indian Muslims (one-quarter of the population) 
- Some Indians converted to higher their status in society 
	- Rarely worked, as oftentimes an entire caste/subcaste would convert at the same time and if everyone does it, they’re in the same place as before 

### Sufis 
- Sufi mystics were the most effective converters of Islam 
- Encouraged a personal, emotional, devotional approach to Islam 
- Instead of focusing on the specific laws, they were comfortable for followers and more personal 
	- Similar to Hinduism, “Indian Islam emphasized piety and devotion.” 

### The Bhakti Movement 
- The gap between Islam and Hinduism was narrowed because both religions took old traditions and implemented it 
	- Sufis tried to imitate Indian gurus, Hindu religious leaders 
- The bhakti movement was “a cult of love and devotion that ultimately sought to **erase the distinction between Hinduism and Islam**”
	- Bhakti literally means "attachment, participation, fondness for, homage, faith, love, devotion, worship, purity” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti))
- Originated in southern India during the 1100s 
	- Initially promoted traditional piety and devotion to Hindu values 
- As it spread to the north, bhakti leaders really liked certain Islamic values 
	- Monotheism 
	- Spiritual equality 
#### Guru Kabir (1440-1518)

- A bhakti teacher and a blind weaver 
- Taught that Islam and Hinduism were the same thing and all the Hindu gods were the manifestation of one deity

>[!IMPORTANT] The bhakti movement could not unite Islam and Hinduism, but it did make connections between social and cultural connections
