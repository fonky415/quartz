# India and the Indian Ocean Basin 
India was a lot like China back in the tenth century, influencing the “development of a larger cultural zone in south and south-east Asia.” But India didn’t have that dominant power China did. Nevertheless, India, through powerful social and cultural traditions (caste system, Hinduism, Islam, etc.), spread its traditions and techniques to southeast Asia.
