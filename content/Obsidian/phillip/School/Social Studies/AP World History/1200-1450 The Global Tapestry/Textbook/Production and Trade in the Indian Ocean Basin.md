# Production and Trade in the Indian Ocean Basin 
- Trade impacted India greatly 
	- Established connections between regions in India and places outside India 
	- Fostered economic development in southern India 
	- Fostered ideas and art 
- Still, the caste system remained strong 

## Agriculture & Irrigation 
- India was large, densly-populated, and very agricultural (still is today)
- **Irrigation was important**  ^d3c858
	- Monsoons in the spring & summer 
	- Little rain in summer → famine during winter 
	- Irrigation had to supply water to the crops during fall and winter 
- Northern India was pretty fine 
	- They have the Indus River and the Ganges River valley 
- Southern India suffered 
	- No major source of water near them for irrigation 
	- Had to build dams, reservoirs, canals, wells, and tunnels 
		- Bhopal Lake, an artifical lake covering 650 square kilometers 

>[!NOTE] Result: massive population growth
>Irrigation and agricultural technology helped increase India’s population from 53 million in 600 C.E. to 105 million in 1500 C.E. This in turn caused **urbanization**.
