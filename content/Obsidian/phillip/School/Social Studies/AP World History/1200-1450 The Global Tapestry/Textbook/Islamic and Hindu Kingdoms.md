# Islamic and Hindu Kingdoms 
- Severe pressure from **nomadic invaders**
- Stable from 350-450 C.E., but from 451 C.E., ==White Huns== from central Asia invaded India 
- **At ≈550 Gupta collapsed**
- From 550 to 1500, **India remains divided**
	- In 1500 Turkish people called the ==Mughals== takes most of the subcontinent 
- Northern and Southern India go two different ways

## Northern India 
- Chaos 
	- Local states fought for power and land
	- ==Nomadic Turks== came from central Asia to take advantage of the disorder, furthering the chaos 

### King Harsha tries but fails 
<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20220827204946.png|400]] </span>

- ==King Harsha== when he was 16 attempted to unify the North 
	- Reigned from 606 to 648 C.E.
- Gained influence and grew a massive army 
	- Even “exchanged a series of embassies with his contemporary, Emperor Tang Taizong of China”
- **Good reputation** 
	- “Piety, liberality, and even scholarship”
		- Patronized scholars 
	- Buddhist, but open to other beliefs 
	- Built hospitals & provided free medical care 
	- Equal wealth distribution 
- Regardless, **Harsha was unable to restore permanent centralized rule**
	- After Gupta fell, the local kings had solidified their power too well for Harsha to overcome 
	- Harsha got assassinated and because he had no heir, his empire immediately fell apart 

### 4 ways [[Islam]] came into India 
Most came through war, but it’s good to hear that at least one was less violent and through trade. 

#### 1. Invasion of Sind 
<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20220827210637.png|400]] </span>

- Arab forces start coming into India in around 650 C.E.
- The ==Umayyad Caliphate== then later conquered Sind in 711 C.E. 
- Then at around 750 C.E., Sind gets passed onto the ==Abbasid caliphs==

- Because Sind was right at the edge of the Abbasid caliphate, most of the population remained Hindu, Buddhist, or Parsee 
- Local political elites often tried to reassert Hindu authority among the infighting between the Arab administrators 
- Wasn’t enough though, and continued to be under the Abbasdi caliphate’s rule until the dynasty’s collapse in 1258 

#### 2. Muslim merchants 
- Trade 
	- **Brought their faith to costal regions in both northern and southern India** 
	- Even before Islam was a thing, Arab and Persian sailers had already established strong trade networks 
- Role in India 
	- Formed small communities in the major cities along the coast 
	- Had a “prominent role in Indian business and commercial life“
	- Frequently married Indian women 

#### 3. Attacks from Mahmud of Ghazni 

![[Pasted image 20220828063904.png]]

- Thanks to the Abbasid caliphate, several Turkic groups had also converted to Islam during the 10th century 
- ==Mahmud of Ghazni==  ^990aa1
	- Leader of the Afghanistan Turks and the Ghaznavid Empire 
	- **Made 17 raids from 1001 to 1027 to get riches stored in Indian temples** 
		- Hastened the decline of Buddhism by destroying temples 
		- Replaced those temples with mosques 
	- Took several states in northwestern India and the Punjab (close to Lahore)
- **However, this wasn’t effective in converting the Indians to Islam** 
	- I mean, if someone destroyed all your temples and built Islamic ones, why would I choose to worship that god? 

#### 4. Sultanate of Delhi
- Mahmud’s successors incorporated a more systematic campaign 
- By 1200, most of the Hindu kingdoms in northern India is conquered
	- Established an Islamic state called the [[Delhi Sultanate]] (1206-1526) 
- Not very powerful, but still secured Islam in India 

## Southern India 
- Less chaos than the north 
	- Rivalry between Hindu rulers of small states was much less 
- Many regional states, but two prominent kingdoms: 
	- Chola Kingdom 
	- Kingdom of Vijayanagar 

### Chola Kingdom 
![[Pasted image 20220828072316.png]]

- Ruled the Coromandel coast from 850 to 1267 C.E.
- At its acme in the 11th century it conquered Ceylon (the island at the bottom of India) and parts of southeast Asia 
- Huge navy thanks to profits from trade 
	- South China Sea to the Arabian Sea 

![[Pasted image 20220828073051.png]]

- “Chola rulers did not build a tightly centralized state”
	- Allowed villages and local areas to do what they wanted as long as they paid taxes 
- Profits from trade > desire for centralization 
- **This decentralization led to a decline by the 12th century** 
	- Native Sinhalese forces kicked Chola out from Ceylon 
	- Revolts within southern India 
	- Just became another one of those small regional kingdoms by the 13th century 

### Kingdom of Vijayanagar

- Two brothers, Harihara and Bukka, got sent to southern India by officials in Delhi but decided to become leaders themselves 
- Returned to Hinduism (they had switched to Islam before) in 1336 and established an independent empire of Vijayanagar (“city of victory”)
- Worked until 1565 when they got attacked by Muslim kingdoms
