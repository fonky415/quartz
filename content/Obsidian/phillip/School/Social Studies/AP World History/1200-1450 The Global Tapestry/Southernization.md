# Southernization 
Notes based on [[Southernization-Lynda_Shaffer_w_Discussion_Questions.pdf|this]] paper by Lynda Shaffer, Tufts University. 

## The Indian Beginning 
- Indians started 

## Conclusion 
- Began exclusively as a Southern Asian thing but eventually spread through upwards 
- Stimulated both the development of China and the Middle East 
- Mongols conduced environment for southernization 
- Prob trade 
- Order of affect (kinda): 
	1. East Asia 
	2. Middle East 
	3. Africa 
	4. Mediterranean 
	5. Northwestern Europe 
	6. Portions of the Western Hemisphere 
- Only got beaten by Westernization with the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century 
- Then the south got completely screwed over by the British thanks to industrial revolution 
- Westerns can’t get cocky about saying that they’re better than yellow people because without southernization they would’ve never gotten this far anyhow 
>[!QUOTE] Both the ocean crossing that knit together two hemispheres and the Industrial Revolution were indeed unprecedented. But their roots are insepar- able from the process of southernization. Only after the northwestern Europeans had added to their own repertoire every one of the elements of southernization did the world became divided into a powerful, prestigious, and rich north and an impoverished south perceived to be in need of development.
