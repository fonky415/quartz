To chengis’s wife: you’re only saying this because you love gengis khan! 

>To avoid war, [Genghis Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan "Genghis Khan") and his generals preferred to offer their enemies a chance to surrender without resistance. These enemies would then become [vassals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassals "Vassals") by sending tribute, accepting Mongol residents, and/or contributing troops. In return, the [Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khagan#Mongol_khagans "Khagan") would guarantee their protection, but only if those who submitted to Mongol rule were obedient.

What about diplomacy? Why did the Mongols have to resort to total war? 

## Notes during trial 
- necessary vs unnecessary 
- Not relevant 

## Opening statement 
May it please the court, opposing counsel, and members of the jury. Today, my team will prove that Chinggis Khan, his son Ogedei, and his grandsons Kublai Khan, Batu, Chagatai, and Hulegu of three offenses: 1, of war crimes, 2, of using relatively excessive brutality, and 3, setting inhumane standards of warfare for future wars. A total of five witnesses will speak in court today. The first witness, Abdul-Baset, is a Balkh shopkeeper who got his family and his life torn apart by the Mongol Army for simply being born in the wrong generation. The second is Qutuz, Mamluk sultan of Egypt. Born into royal blood, but thanks to the Mongols, his dreams of being a successful leader was tainted by fresh images of blood and violence. Next is a prince of Kiev called Mstislav III. Betrayed by the Mongols, Mstislav lost everything he loved and died a horrible death. Not a hint of mercy was given to this poor man. Fourthly, we have Mustasim, the last caliph of Baghdad before its destruction by the Mongols. Mustasim will talk about the Sack of Baghdad in 1258 and the horrors its poor people faced during that time. And last but not least, Ala ad-Dunya wa ad-Din Abul-Fath Muhammad Sanjar ibn Tekish, or Muhammad II for short, will relate how his life was shattered beyond repair thanks to the Mongol Empire. We hope that by the end of the hour, the members of the jury understand the sufferings of each witness here today and make the right verdict. Thank you.

## Closing statement 
(May be slightly altered during trial.) Briefly putting aside all the evidence and specific circumstances the witnesses today have explained today, I would like to remind the members of the jury that a death is a death. To someone as powerful as Chinggis Khan or Kublai Khan, the death of some unknown merchant or shopkeeper might seem trivial, but to the relatives and loved ones of the deceased, the entire world has collapsed upon them. These colossal numbers and gigantic scales of mass destruction must not downplay the resonance of these deaths, but amplify them, for when all is said and done, a murder is, and will forever be, a murder. Nothing can justify the killings of completely innocent civilians. Genghis Khan and his creations, however, have destroyed the lives of millions, all for a cause their victims have never even heard of or have any say in. Too many people have suffered inhumane conditions and deaths due to the invasions of the cold-blooded creatures for the “greater good.” Now, on top of the evidence displayed today, the crimes against humanity committed by the Mongols could not have been more obvious. As blatant transgressors of civilized warfare, the Mongols shocked the world of man’s cruelty and opened the world to an even greater possibility of it. Let the jury hope for blue waters, plump babies, filled bookshelves, and a peaceful world.
