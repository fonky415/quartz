# Chinggis Khan 
A uniter and conquerer. 

>[!QUOTE] “The greatest happiness is to vanquish your enemies, to chase them before you, to rob them of their wealth, to see those dear to them bathed in tears, to clasp to your bosom their wives and daughters.”

## Origin
### Early ages 
- Real name: Temujin 
- Born in a nomadic tribe in 1162 near the border between modern Mongolia and Siberia 
- Father died early when Temujin was only nine 

### Gaining power 
- Tumujin became the head of his household by killing his older half-brother 
- Was nearly captured by the clan that had abandoned him but managed to escape 
- Married Borte in 1178 
	- 4 sons, unknown number of daughters 
- “Most of what we know about Genghis Khan’s childhood comes from ‘The Secret History of the Mongols,’ the oldest known work of Mongolian history and literature, which was written soon after his death.” (HISTORY)

## Chinggis Khan unifies the Mongols 
- Incorporated several strategies conducive to his success:
	1. Placed competent allies in important positions rather than relatives 
	2. “[…]ordered that all looting wait until after a complete victory had been won” (HISTORY)
	3. “[…]organized his warriors into units of 10 without regard to kin” (HISTORY) 
	4. Allow religious tolerance (he himself was animist but allowed his follwers to practice their own)
- By 1205 he took out all his rivals 
- The same year, “he called a meeting of representatives from every part of the territory and established a nation similar in size to modern Mongolia” (HISTORY) 
	- ≈ 1 million people 
- Became known as Chinggis Khan, “Universal Ruler”

## Establishment of an empire

### Chinggis’ strategy 
- Abolishment of inherited aristocratic titles 
- Selling & kidnapping of women 
- Abolishment of Mongol slavery 
- Adoption of a writing system

- “diplomatic immunity to foreign ambassadors” (HISTORY)
- Religious tolerance 

### Invasion of the Xi Xia kingdom 
- Northwestern China 
- Used a lot of horses 
- Held siege on the capital, Yinchuan for around 6 months 
- Chinggis had died by then, and “In September 1227, Emperor Mozhu surrendered to the Mongols and was promptly executed. The Mongols then mercilessly pillaged Yinchuan, slaughtered the city's population, plundered the imperial tombs west of the city, and completed the effective annihilation of the Western Xia state.” (Wikipedia) 

### Invasion of the Jin Dynasty 
- Northern China 
- Ruler demanded Chinggis for his submission 
- 1211 to 1214: Mongols enter the countryside 
	- Mongols take over the countryside and force people to flee into the cities 
	- This results in food shortages which the Jin army deals with by killing tens of thousands of its own peasants 
- 1214: besiege the capital of Zhongdu (now Beijing)
	- Jin ruler
