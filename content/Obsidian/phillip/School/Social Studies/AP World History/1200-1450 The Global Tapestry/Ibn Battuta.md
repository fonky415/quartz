traveller

## Anatolia (1330 - 1331)
![[Pasted image 20220831205353.png]]
- Located in modern Turkey
- Arrived in Alanya (Alaya) in Anatolia 
	- Busy trading port 
	- Known for its wood which came from Syria to Egypt 
- Conquered by the Muslims but still a lot of Christians 
	- Christians treated him well 
- Everyone was really nice 
- Battuta was surprised that it was common to eat hashish, a drug similar to marijuana 
- Next went to Antaliya (Adalia)
	- Christians, Greeks, Jews, and the kings live all separately, walled off 
	- Muslims lived in the main city 
- Dancing and whirling were popular in the Turkish and Persian culture 
- Women were respected a lot 
	- Women didn’t cover their entire face 
	- Still, there were slave girls 
>What a beautiful place with such beautiful people, both inside and out. There were a lot of Christians here even though it was conquered by Muslims, all of them who were really nice to us. Battua and I were pretty surprised that taking drugs were not rare, though. Maybe that’s why they’re all so nice. After visiting Alanya, we made our way to Antaliya. Here, we were welcomed by more Muslims, because the Christians, Jews, and Greeks were separated from the main city where the Muslims lived. Nonetheless, the Muslims were no less friendly and even entertained us with fun dancing and whirling. It was also fascinating to see the women treated much more equally than other places we visited. For example, they didn’t have to cover their entire face. In fact, men could be servants of women. That was really fascinating. There were still a lot of slave girls as usual, which Battuta took as gifts. I wish to return here someday.

## Lands of the Golden Horde & the Chagatai: (1332 - 1333)
- Barely cross the Black Sea 
- Reach Kaffa (Genoese/Italian colony) 
	- 200 ships in harbor 
- Merchants from Genoa, Venice, Egypt, Russia, and more 
	- Grains 
	- Timber 
	- Furs 
	- Salt 
	- Wax 
	- Honey 
	- Slaves 
- Most were Christian, so only one mosque in town 
- Eventually moved to a place with more Muslims 
- Traveled with the King of the Gold Horde 
	- The northwestern khanate 
- Battuta how well women were treated 
- Went to Constantinople with Khan’s third pregnant wife in 75 days 
	- Wife was Christian so as she got closer to Constantinople she started drinking wine and eating pork and stopped praying 
	- Stayed there for a month 
	- Saw the great cathedral of Hagia Sophia from outside 
- Returns travelling in the steppe in the harsh Asian winter 
- Traveled through the regions conquered by the Mongols 
	- Pure destruction, nothing left 
- Stays in the land of the Khan of Chagatay 
	- Descendant of Genghis Khan 
	- Tarmashirin, the present Khan, made Islam the official religion 
	- Battuta was treated kindly 
>After barely managing to cross the Black Sea, we stayed at a truly cosmopolitan harbor: Kaffa. I saw so many people from so many places from Egypt to Russia selling all kinds of goods. Most were Christian though, because they were mostly European, with only one mosque in town, so Battuta decided to go to a more Muslim place. We then travelled with the King of the Gold Horde, ruler of the northwestern khanate. The time we spent with the Turks was truly extraordinary, from their exotic food and the way they treated the women. Here, too, the women didn’t have to cover their faces and could hold a significant position. We actually followed one to Constantinople, the third wife of Khan, who got pregnant. Turns out that she wasn’t really Muslim and was actually Christian and only married to him for political purposes. Anyhow, Constantinople was also great. The great cathedral of Hagia Sophia looked majestic.

## Delhi (1334 - 1341)

![[Pasted image 20220829145802.png]]

- Battuta entered India in 1334 
- Got hired by Sultan Muhammad Tughluq because Battuta was a foreigner 
	- Battuta gifted Tughluq “arrows, several camels, thirty horses, and several slaves and other goods”
	- Tughluq didn’t trust the Hindus because he was scared that they would rebel against him 
	- Very cruel man in general, Tughluq 
- Was gifted 2,000 silver dinars and a comfortable house 
- Worked as a judge 
	- Got a lot of money 
- There was a famine in 1335-1342 in North India 
	- Battuta did some charity to the poor 
- Meanwhile, the entire empire was falling apart with rebellions 
- Later, Battuta made himself a Sufi friend 
	- This guy got killed by Tughluq 
- Battuta was scared of being killed himself, so he hid for five months 
- Upon returning back to the palace and Tughluq, Battuta is assigned to be an ambassador to the Mongols in China 

>Ahh, Alhamdulillah, that was way too close. I knew I should’ve never trusted Sultan Muhammad Tughluq. It was pretty nice in the beginning with the fancy house and all that money he gave us, but I should’ve convinced Ibn to get the hell out of here a long time ago. All the delicious dishes and fruits wavered my levelheadedness. We’re so lucky to be alive right now. Maybe it was the charity we did to the poor during the famine those years ago that saved us. I do sort of miss the landscape of Delhi, though. The massive, stone mosques took my breath away every single time, and I was absolutely stunned by the food there too. Anyway, Tughluq is crazy. I’m glad we’re out of here.

## Maldive Islands (1341 - 1344)

>Getting there was precarious and perilous, but I would say that it was worth it. It’s paradise here. Sure, the rulers kinda forced Battuta to stay, but at least the sultan here is less psychopathic. Battuta got himself involved with all kinds of messy politics, but meanwhile, I had a great time eating coconuts, extravagant jewelries, and even some slave girls Battuta didn’t like. It’s pretty different here compared to some of the other places we’ve travelled. One of the first things I’ve noticed were how the Maldive women were dressed; they dressed very sparingly above their waists, sometimes not wearing anything at all. Considering that they too were Muslim, it was interesting to see the different standards here for women and clothing. 

## Sri Lanka (1344-1344)
- Visited Sri Lanka on the way to China to go to a holy site: Adam’s Peak 
	- Sacred for Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists 
- Battuta met the king there and got his permission to climb the mountain 
- Camped for three days in the top 
- Getting out of Ceylon was not easy 
	- Storm 
	- Twelve pirate ships attacked him 
- Eventually went back to Calicut and from there rode a [[Production and Trade in the Indian Ocean Basin#^9550ba|junk]] to China 
>Departing from the Maldives, I was pretty excited to summit Adam’s Peak, but after actually climbing up there, it was not worth it. It was interesting to see all Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists come up there and pray, but for my heavy body, the hike up there was not a treat. And now that I think about it, I don’t think the gods even liked us going all the way up there, considering what happened to us when we tried to get out of Ceylon. Or maybe they blessed us and allowed us to escape by the skin of our teeth. Gods work in mysterious ways.

## China (1345 - 1346)
- China had a lot of ports that were full of Muslims 
- A lot of Malay people were converting to Islam at that time 
- Went to Chittagong 
	- Filled with food that smelled bad 
	- Very cheap stuff, including slaves 
- Went up the Meghna River to Sylhet 
	- Met a holy man could supposedly predict the future 
- Went to Samudra on the island of Sumatra 
- Finally reaches China 
	- Does not appreciate China’s very different culture 
>[!quote] "China was beautiful, but it did not please me. On the contrary, I was greatly troubled thinking about the way paganism dominated this country. Whenever I went out of my lodging, I saw many blameworthy things. That disturbed me so much that I stayed indoors most of the time and only went out when necessary. During my stay in China, whenever I saw any Muslims I always felt as though I were meeting my own family and close kinsmen." [Dunn, p. 258]
- But describes it as safe (just before the collapse of the Mongol dynasty) 
>After a couple detours, we finally made it to China. And although it felt pretty safe, it also felt very foreign and unfamiliar. Despite being a traveler of the world, I’ve pretty much lived only with Muslims and Islamic culture for the entirety of my life. Experiencing China’s culture was a completely new experience for me, and for Battuta as well. There were so many religions being practiced there, such as Buddhism, Christianity, and Manichaeism. I did meet a few Muslims here and there, though, which was really nice. Oh, and it was cool to see some coconuts from Maldives being used to make sweetmeats.
