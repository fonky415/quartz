## Questions
**1. How did a man rise to power in the court of Đại Việt at this time?**
He supposedly came down from heaven from being a god and lived a perfect life, ruling the way a god would rule its followers. 

**2. What was the role of women in the court?**
Women had little to no role in the court. Every single article in this document is masculine and there isn’t any mention of women. They were probably just servants. 

**3. Where did the power lie in this court? And how was this power applied in the realm?**
The Đại Việt kingdom was an absolute monarch with the Emperor with supreme power. But a lot of the power also came from religion, shown by the divine description of the duke.
