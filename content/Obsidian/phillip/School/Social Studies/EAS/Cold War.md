# Cold War 
Tags: #EAS #History

: The period of struggle between the two superpowers, US and USSR, as they try to gain global influence 

Why the *"cold"* war? 
	The US or USSR never declared official war, but supported proxy wars (ex. [[Korean War]])

## Background 
### End of WWII 
- Yalta Conference 
	- Allies meet together to decide what's going to happen and try to prevent future wars 
	- USSR helped the US attack Japan in WWII
		- Had occupied Manchuria & northern half of the Korean peninsula 
- Now that WWII has ended, USSR and the US divide Korea along the 38th Parallel 
	- Korea has no government 
	- USSR supports communism in the North 
	- US wants democracy in the South 
- The Iron Curtain (Europe) ![[Iron_Curtain_map.svg.png]]
	###### Blue: Democracy, Red: Communism 
- The Bamboo Curtain (Asia)

### Asia 
- Japan: anti-communist (under US military control)
- China: Mao and the communists win over the Nationalists in civil war 
- Taiwan: US-backed Nationalist government 

### New World Order 
1. First world: democratic, industrial nations influenced by the US 
1. Second world: communist, socialist industrial nations influenced by the USSR 
1. Third World: non-industrial, non-aligned nations (often fought over by the US and USSR)

### [[The United Nations|United Nations]] 
- The UN has a vote for what will happen to Korea 
- Note: Korea has no say about anything and other countries decide 

**First idea: Four party trusteeship (US, UK, China, USSR) for five years**
Result: Hated by Koreans who wanted immediate independence. UK and China lost interest.

**Second idea: US and USSR joint control** 
Result: The two superpowers grew more and more distrustful and couldn’t agree on anything.

**Final Decision (UN Elections for immediate Korean independence)**

## 1948 Election Failure 
- Though many Koreans opposed it (Kim Gu), the elections proceeded and were the first democratic elections ever in Korea.
- Syngman Rhee won easily in the South, but the North and the USSR did not allow election officials in. 
- Syngman Rhee declared the “Republic of Korea” in the South.
- Soon after, Kim Il-Sung declared the “Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” in the North. 
- After elections, US and USSR pull out their military and leave Korea divided 

## 1949-50: US on thin ice 
- China falls to Communism 
- USSR obtains the Atom Bomb 
- North Korea gets permission from Russia to invade South Korea 

## [[Korean War]] 
- when the UN holds an election whether to help south korea in the korean war, the vote goes through–russia wasn't there 
- UN helps South Korea 
- Proxy war–US & Russia 

## Questions 
Answer some questions to check your understanding. 

**1. When was the Yalta Conference and who attended it? What was its purpose?** 
	In Yalta, Ukraine, the Yalta Conference was when the winners of WWII, the Allies, got together and talked about what's going to happen after the war. The British, US, and Russia talked about how they can prevent future wars from happening. 
	
**2. What was the plan for Korea after the surrender of the Japanese and how did the Korean people react to this plan? Why do you think the Koreans reacted this way?**
	The US and Russia divide Korea into South and North Korea along the 38th parallel. Russia allows North Korea to have a communist government, while the US disallows any kind of government in South Korea. The Koreans didn't like this, because they wanted immediate independence and because no one listened to Korea and did whatever they wanted. 

**3. Where did the phrase "Iron Curtain" come from? Who first said it?**
	Winston Churchill is often attributed for coining the phrase, "Iron Curtain," but he is not the first person who used it in this context. The earliest instance of the phrase comes from Ethel Snowden's _Throughout Bolshevik Russia,_ (1920) where it's specifically about communism. 

	"At last we were to enter the country where the Red Flag had become a national emblem, and was flying over every public building in the cities of Russia. The thought thrilled like new wine … We were behind the ‘iron curtain’ at last!" 
&nbsp; Churchill might've popularize the phrase, but he was not the first one to say it. ([TIME](https://time.com/3733955/winston-churchill-did-not-coin-the-phrase-iron-curtain/))

**4. How was Asia divided politically by 1950? Hint: Think about the political spectrum.**
	By 1950, China had turned into a communist state, with Mao's victory over the Nationalists in their civil war. Communism was taking over Asia, and China had fallen to it. 

**5.  What was the UN plan for the Korean peninsula after WW2?**
	Korea was to be divided into North and South Korea and be given its own government. The Koreans weren't very satisfied, as no one listened to what the Koreans actually wanted and other countries in the UN just did what they wanted. 

**6. Why did the UN Plan fail?**
    North Korea wanted to unify the countries and invaded South Korea. Furthermore, the North Korean elections were rigged. 

**7.  How did the UN and the world react to the failure of the UN Plan?**
	The UN supported South Korea in the Korean War and helped fight the Chinese & North Korean.
