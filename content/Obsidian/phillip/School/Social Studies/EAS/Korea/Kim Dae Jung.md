Eighth present of South Korea from 1998 to 2003, Kim Dae Jung was the “symbol of the South Korean struggle for democracy and the dream of reconciliation, and eventual reunification with North Korea,” ([[Kim Dae Jung Obituary|New York Times]]) often called the “Nelson Mandela of Asia.”

### Park's response 
- 1971 possible assassination attempt 
	- One month after 1971 elections, a truck directly hit his car and got a hip joint injury 
	- Kim fled to Japan and started an exile movement as Park promulgated the Yushin Constitution of 1972 
- 1973 kidnapping 
	- Kidnapped from a hotel in Tokyo by the KCIA 
	- Kim had openly criticized the Yushin Constitution 
>I have lived, and continue to live, in the belief that God is always with me. I know this from experience. In August of 1973, while exiled in Japan, I was kidnapped from my hotel room in Tokyo by intelligence agents of the then military government of South Korea. The news of the incident startled the world. The agents took me to their boat at anchor along the seashore. They tied me up, blinded me, and stuffed my mouth. Just when they were about to throw me overboard, Jesus Christ appeared before me with such clarity. I clung to him and begged him to save me. At that very moment, an airplane was sent down from Heavens by the almighty God Himself to rescue me from the moment of death.

## Sunshine Policy 
### Fable 
- The North Wind and the Sun by Aesop 
	- Wind tried to blow off a traveler's clothes, but he clung on harder 
	- Sun made it really hot so the traveler would take it off himself 
- This can be seen in Kim's policies 
	- Instead of threatening the North or forcing them, Kim tried to be nice and be the Sun like in the fable
