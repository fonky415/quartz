In "[Why Did Mao, Nehru and Tagore Applaud the March First Movement?](https://web.archive.org/web/20110928102203/http://www.koreafocus.or.kr/design2/layout/content_print.asp?group_id=102423)" written by Shin Yong-ha published in the Chosun Ilbo, February 27, 2009, Shin remarks: 
#### "If the day comes when the world history is written in such a truthful way as “Glimpses of World History” authored by Nehru, then the March First Movement should be reassessed as the first beacon that lighted the hope for freedom for three-fourths of mankind."
