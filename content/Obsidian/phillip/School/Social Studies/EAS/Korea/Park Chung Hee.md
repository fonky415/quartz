## Was Park Chung Hee's Leadership style justified?
Park Chung Hee's leadership style was not justified. He and his advisors' achievements on the economy of South Korea were mostly great, but the methods he used in order to fulfilled it can never be justified. Not only did he repress thousands of individuals, Park reversed South Korea's hard-earned democracy through the establishment of the Yusin Constitution and the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA), enabling him to control the economy at his will. The number of lives he paid for that, however, despite the leaps of economic growth South Korea had in the 1960~70s, can never be forgiven. 

There are countless evidences of repression in Park's regime. Indiscriminate of age or sex, Park and his increasingly powerful military arrested any dissident, including students. One of the first examples of this was in October of 1971, when Park had announced a constitutional amendment that allowed him to re-run for president for the second time. Many students protested before and after the presidential election that year, so Park declared a garrison decree, and proceeded to arrest more than a thousand students, mostly with brute force. Furthermore, Park "frequently spied on, harassed, investigated, detained, and tortured participants in the democracy movement" with the KCIA, which is the South Korea intelligence agency, now called Agency for National Security Planning (NSP). The KCIA had no legal bounds in its activities, and used North Korean spies as scapegoat. 

Park also used "emergency decrees" (ED) to transition South Korea into authoritarianism. In Article 53 of the Yusin Constitution, its usage was "for the maintenance of ‘national security’ and ‘public peace and order,'" but Park had different intentions. Through the nine EDs, Park managed to tighten his authoritarian grip on all facets of South Korean society, including the judicial system and free speech. This resulted in a vicious circle, as more people protested as more people, especially student activists, were arrested and tortured. This led to more EDs, and so on and so forth. 

It is clear that Park was actively turning South Korea into an authoritarian state. Nothing can be traded with democracy and the happiness of the citizens, even a strong economy. If Park had not been assassinated and continued his rule over South Korea, only the top 1% would live luxuriously while the bottom 99% labor endlessly for the nation's economy. Park placed the country's immediate needs before the citizens, but also placed himself before the country.
