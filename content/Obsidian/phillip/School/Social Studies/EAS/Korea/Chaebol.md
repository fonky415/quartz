"A group of massive, mostly family-run business conglomerates, called chaebol_,_ dominates South Korea’s economy and wields extraordinary influence over its politics. These powerful entities played a central role in transforming what was once a humble agrarian market into one of the world’s largest economies.

The South Korean government has generously supported the chaebol since the early 1960s, nurturing internationally recognized brands such as Samsung and Hyundai. However, in recent years chaebol have come under fire amid a slowing South Korean economy and following a series of high-profile corruption scandals, including one that prompted mass protests and the ouster of Park Geun-hye."

## What is it? 
- 재벌(財閥) 
	- 재 → wealth 
	- 벌 → clan 
- Family-owned 
- Typically expands over many industries 
- Close with the government 
	- Subsidiary support 
	- Loans 
	- Tax incentives 

## Largest chaebols 
The top five chaebols make up around half of the South Korean stock market. Here are the top five. 

### Samsung 
### Hyundai 
### SK Group 
### LG 
### Lotte 

## How did chaebols emerge? 
- Beginnings in the Japanese occupation in World War II 
- Chaebols modeled after the zaibatsu 
	- Japanese version of chaebols 
- [[Park Chung Hee]] invested hundreds of millions of dollars to chaebols 
	- U.S. & International aid gave a lot of money after Korean War 
	- Concentrated on construction, chemicals, oil, and steel industry 
	- Prioritized exporting 
- Exports grew from 4% of GDP in 1961 to 40% in 2016 
- Average income rose from $120 per year to $27,000 (USD in 2018) 

## Effect of democratization and the 1997 financial crisis 
- Democratization brought about the formation of strong labor unions 
	- Fought for higher wages 
	- Better working conditions 
	- More separation between the government and the chaebol 
- 1997 Asian financial crisis tested the chaebol system 
	- Banks lent a lot of money to the chaebols during the build-up of the crisis 
		- Result: fifteen out of the top thirty got bankrupt 
	- South Korea asked for over $50 billion international bailout package 
		- Conditions set by the International Monetary Fund: 
			- Weakening of the chaebol system 
			- More corporate transparency 
			- Cuts in government subsidies 
		- Outcome: 
			- Reduction of government deficits 
			- Restructuring of insolvent financial institutions 
			- Liberalization of trade & foreign investment 

## How close are chaebol to the government? 
- Mutually beneficial relationship 
- Tight connections with South Korean politics, culture, & history 
>"The large conglomerates and Korean economy cannot be separated from the politics and the culture and history." (Rhyu Sang-young, Yonsei University) 
- **This tight relationship fosters corruption** 
	- President Park Geun-hye's corruption with chaebols got caught and was sentenced to prison 
	- Politicians would bribe chaebols to lobby for them 
	- Top executives from chaebols who are convicted have their sentences shortened or can just pay a fine instead 
		- Around 70% of chaebol executives recived a reduced prison sentence 
- Chaebols' successes don't always mean that the country is doing well as well 
	- South Korea's economic growth saw negative growth while chaebols have expanded in capitalization and scope 
	- → causing social inequality 

## Challenges with the chaebol 
- Chaebols make the economy difficult for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to compete in the market 
	- Often, chaebols just copy innovative ideas from the SMEs and allow zero competition 
	- This is a problem, as SMEs provide most of South Korea's employment 
- Growing wage gap 
	- Workers in SMEs earn 63% of chaebol workers' pay 
	- High youth unemployment rates 
- Less social trust 

>"...cultural relic poorly suited to the 21st-century economy." - Peter Pae from Bloomberg

## Chaebol Reform 
- During President Moon Jae-in's presidential term, he has accomplished little to nothing 
	- Mostly due to the chair composition with Republicans and Democrats
