My project focuses on Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution and its successful aspects compared to George Orwell’s *1984*. It was interesting to make connections between Orwell’s Ingsoc and Mao’s Cultural Revolution through specific systems and policies in Ingsoc and Mao’s China. I presented my parallels through Mao’s perspective on a handbook, and included footnotes for explanation. This project goes beyond what was taught in the classroom, as it explores themes not only of Mao or *1984,* but of politics as a whole, including linguistic manipulation and historical revisionism. Although such topics weren’t explored in much depth in this project, I believe that my research and exposure to those topics gave me a valuable perspective on the relationship between the government and the people. But in the end, it’s clear that my project didn’t meet the specific requirements, as it has no arguable claim–all I have done was gather pieces of well-accepted facts and put them together in a somewhat creative medium. You, however, made an exception to the project requirements and allowed my interest in this topic to create something that, despite being unoriginal, has been very interesting to make. I hope you, too, find my project fun to look over, and maybe have something click in your brain like it did for me.
