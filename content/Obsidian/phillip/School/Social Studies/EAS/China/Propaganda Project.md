## Message 
The message of this poster to its viewers is that game-addicts are useless to society and must be stopped. Refusing to stop playing games will not only result in losing social credit, but endanger the wellbeing of the party through influence. Doing productive activities such as reading, however, will increase one’s credits. This ensures that citizens are healthy, socially interactive, and productive in activities that further the state. 

## Propaganda techniques 
The main propaganda technique used in this poster is name-calling, where the subject of the propaganda is labeled with loaded language, which in this case, is negative. In this poster, strong words such as “banish,” “worthless,” and “degenerates” instantly give the reader a sense of negativity towards the “game-addict” in the center of the poster. 

Furthermore, calling the addict “pollution” is an example of name-calling, as “pollution” already has a very negative connotation that is familiar to the public sentiment. This can lead to the viewer making unbacked assumptions about game-addicts from what they connect the name “pollution” with. 

## Targeted audience 
While anyone could be a game-addict, males from the ages 18-24 are most susceptible to becoming one according to the [Recovery Village](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/process-addiction/video-game-addiction/gaming-addiction-statistics/), making them the primary audience of this poster. 

## Artistic techniques 
There are many details in this piece of propaganda that might be overlooked by the conscious mind, but the subconscious consumes it all, insidiously affecting the viewer’s decision-making. The three most important techniques in this poster are lighting, contrast in color, and shape. 

The first technique used to create a sense of good and evil is lighting & shading. Towards the top right corner of the poster where the book is, the background is the lightest. The book itself also emits a halo, representing good. Around the man, on the other hand, the background grows darker, symbolizing evil in game-addiction. This contrast in lighting clearly defines what is good and what is bad. 

Secondly, the contrast in the color of the addict (or the lack of it) and the rest of the photo is used as an artistic technique. The addict has no color, only black and white. Everywhere around him, however, has a distinct red color. This juxtaposition of the presence of color emphasizes the addict as alien, unbelonging in his community. 

Lastly, shape is used as an artistic technique. The addict has an overly circular shape, with its round body and compact figure. The book, on the other hand, is elongated, sharp, and thin. The contrast in shape has similar functions to the contrast in color, which was to emphasize the subject of the poster, the man; however, this technique also shows how the book is overpowering the addict as it’s pinning him to the ground. In the battle between a healthy lifestyle and game-addiction, the healthy lifestyle is clearly winning. 

## Relation to Chinese Propaganda 
In the original propaganda this poster was based on, Luo Ruiqing, a military general and politician, is being pinned down by a giant fist, portrayed as weak with frail arms broken legs. (This is referring to the legs he broke in his suicide attempt.) The social credit poster has a similar layout of the original with the subject being pinned down by a stronger symbol. In the original, the fist represents Mao and the party, whereas the book represents productiveness and health. Other elements were borrowed from the original, such as the white text in the bottom or the red background of the poster.
