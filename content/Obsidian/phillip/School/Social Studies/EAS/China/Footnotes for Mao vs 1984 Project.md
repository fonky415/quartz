# Footnotes for Mao vs 1984 Project 
Created: 2022-06-02 19:13  

The footnotes will be in a pink marker. 

## Ministry of Love 
1. According to F. Quei Quo, who was a professor of Political Science at Simon Fraser University, “Orwell's _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ shows the Stalinist rule of terror by the secret police; but Mao's Cultural Revolution was mob-rule caused by his fantasy of populism.” This is one of the main differences between Mao and other Marxists, such as Stalin, that truly make the Cultural Revolution, a revolution. 

2. The Cultural Revolution flipped the hierarchy in society, so students began denouncing and children humiliated their parents as well, according to Xing Lu as cited on Wikipedia. 

3. This is one of the quotes in his book, “Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-Tung”. Although its original source is someplace else, this quote became famous thanks to his Little Red Book.

## Ministry of Truth 
### Exercise 2 
1. According to Quo, "Everything was crowned with 'victory', as Orwell predicted, or turned 'red' as Mao preferred: Victory cigarette, Victory Oilfield, Red Machine Factory, Red Star Restaurant, and so on." 
2. In The Theory and Practice of Chinese Revisionism and Social Imperalism, the writer (who I couldn’t identify) notes, “The Chinese revisionists didn’t rest content with this slander on Marx’s analysis as being “abstract”, but they went further–they went on to say that Marx didn’t envisage commodity production and class struggle in the first phase of communism. But why have the Chinese revisionists done this? Because, they see it necessary to totally distort Marxism-Leninism, in order to have the proletariat and labouring masses of China accept Mao Tse-tung’s theory as the only “genuine revolutionary” theory, and thus, prepare better conditions to go all out for developing capitalist relations further, expanding its bureaucracy by bringing in more technocrats, specialists, experts, trained by the Yugoslav revisionists, and by Japanese and U.S. imperialism.“
3. One such example of this is the massacre that happened in Tiananmen Square. Mao’s historical revisionism continues today. 
4. In Shanghai and Beijing, Jian Qing's "literary gangs" who took the pennames of 'Lian Hsiao' and 'Ro Suding' rewrote historical stories, according to Quo, who transformed heros to villians, and vice versa. There is a joke about Deng Xiaoping that shows this appropriately: 

Three inmates in a Peking prison asked each other how they had gotten into such a fix.
"I am here because I supported Deng Xiaoping," said one, referring to China's controversial vice premier.
"I am here because I opposed Deng Xiaoping," said the second inmate.
The two looked at the third man who said: "I am Deng Xiaoping."

### Exercise 3

- According to Fengyuan, “These terms are taken from Red Guard Publications, vol. 5, 1035, 1040, 1168; vol. 17, 5438, 5441, 5574; vol. 18, 5855, 5858; vol. 19, 6077. The Red guards took their lead from the official press, whose use of this imagery has been noted by Chuang, Cultural Revolution, 24.” I couldn’t find the original source that this citation is citing to.  
- Here, there is a contradiction with this campaign against the old and his usage of a traditional stories and ancient superstitions that “foster[ed] hatred of class enemies.”  One example is the revision of a book of ghost stories, called *The Story of Not Afraid of Devils*, which serves to “warn that the people's enemies both in China and abroad were like ghosts, that they had the ability to take human form, that some people were 'half-man-half-ghost', and that all enemies with ghostly characteristics had to be unmasked and wiped out.“ (Fengyuan 105)

- According to Fengyuan, Mao Zedong controlled the media that talked about politics, and gave the press the exact language the people must use to be politically correct. 
- Also according to Fengyuan, there was a clear demarcation between good and evil, and symbols were made for the people to connect the good and evil. This made it easier for people to label things as good or evil, and strengthened correlations between different words. For example, capitalism and corruption could be correlated. 


## Ministry of Peace 
### Exercise 4 
- This is from the War and Peace section of Mao’s Little Red Book, but originates from Problems of War and Strategy (November 6, 1938), Selected Works, Vol. II, p. 225. This is similar to 1984, in that everyone works hard to end the war, but the government intentionally perpetuates it for reasons mentioned in this section.
