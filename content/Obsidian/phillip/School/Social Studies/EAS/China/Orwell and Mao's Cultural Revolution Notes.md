# Connections between Orwell and Mao 
Created: 2022-05-13 11:08  

Notes from F Quei Quo's [[Orwell's Nineteen Eighty- Four and Mao's Cultural Revolution]] + my own connections from other texts 

It’s from here: [[Peter Buitenhuis, Ira B. Nadel (eds.) - George Orwell_ A Reassessment-Palgrave Macmillan UK (1988).pdf#page=136]]

## Similarities  
### Characters 
- Big Brother --> Chairman Mao 

#### Goldsteins 
- [[Liu Shaoqi]] 
- Lin Biao 
- [[Deng Xiaoping]]
	- Purged twice 

### Language 
- Newspeak and the jargon of the Cultural Revolution 
- "the 'doublethink' and the ambiguities of 'revolutionary' and 'counter- revolutionary'?" 
- The language is changed so fast that 'the best glossaries of Maoist phraseology are out-of-date a year after being printed' 
- A lot of "B Vocabulary" of 1984 
	- Euphemisms 
	- Ideologically loaded 

#### Important figures who influenced the language of the cultural revolution 
1. Mao 
2. Jiang Qing 
	1. Mao's wife 
2. Chen Boda 
	1. Mao's secretary 
2. Yao Wenyuan 
	1. member of the central cultural revolution group 
2. wu han 
3. Qi Benyu

- Everything is **good and evil** ^af154b
	- interrelated dichotomies of good and evil. 

### Censorship 
- Rewriting of history 
	- For 'Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture has been re-painted, every statue and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered' (p. 290). 
	- "In China the Red Guards ransacked homes, buildings, temples and burnt tons of books, documents and even furniture. They renamed streets, buildings and sometimes even themselves. Everything was crowned with 'victory', as Orwell predicted, or turned 'red' as Mao preferred: Victory cigarette, Victory Oilfield, Red Machine Factory, Red Star Restaurant, and so on." 
- [[Master Notes for EAS project#Ministry of Truth|Ministry of Truth]] 
	- In Shanghai and Beijing, Jian Qing's "literary gangs" who took the pennames of 'Lian Hsiao' and 'Ro Suding' rewrote historical stories 
	- "Good guys were transformed into bad guys and vice-versa. Competent Imperial ministers became anti-revolutionaries and the cruel Empresses were converted to great rulers of the dynasties. All this was the work of what Orwell would have readily recognised as the Ministry of Truth!"

### Ideologies 
- Xenophobia 
	- Speaking of war between the US and the Soviet Union constantly 
	- "War fever"
- Ultra-puritanism 

### Events 
- Two-minutes hate 
- Hate Week 

### Other 
- Pig iron 
	- "Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron" 
	- Mao also produced Pig iron during the [[Great Leap Forward]] with the [[Great Leap Forward#^7ea95b|backyard steel furnaces]]
	- "Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously." 
	- Mao's Second Five Year Plan???? it's all coming together 
- Massive buildings 
	- "The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above ground level, and corresponding ramifications below. Scattered about London there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size. So completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously." 
	- Mao also built huge projects such as ...? 

## Differences 

### Motivation 
- Orwell: "warning sounded by a disillusioned democratic socialist" 
- Mao: "out of his everlasting zeal for revolution"

### Methods 
- Orwell: "Stalinist rule of terror by the secret police"
- Mao: "mob-rule caused by his fantasy of *populism*" 
- Orwell thought that the "proles," or the commonpeople, had no hope in rebellion, but Mao thought differently 
- ![[Orwell's Nineteen Eighty- Four and Mao's Cultural Revolution#^03425b]]
### Setting 
- Orwell: totalitarian society 
- Mao: turning to totalitarian society 
	- destroying all practices inconsistent with Maoism 
	- ex. destroying 4 olds

### Presence of Mao 
- Orwell: Big Brother is never seen in public–no one is sure if he even exists 
- Mao: Mao appears in public many times, has a family, and makes human mistakes 
mao even worked with the peasants https://www.jstor.org/stable/community.31047311
