### Quotes from Mao 
"A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous. A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another." [source](http://large.stanford.edu/history/kaist/references/marx/mao/c2/)
5. Maybe compare war & peace between Mao's China and Ingsoc?
