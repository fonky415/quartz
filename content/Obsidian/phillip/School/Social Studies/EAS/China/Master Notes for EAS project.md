# Master Notes for EAS project 
Created: 2022-05-25 09:41  

## thoughts
- Mao is dumb & made many mistakes 
	- Didn't listen to any professional advise 
	- his plans backfired 
	- caused a lot of deaths 
		- great famine
	- but there was no counterrevolution after his failure 
1. Make a handbook that details **how to be a good communist dictator** 
2. show how mao did all these good things that strengthened his cult of personality 
4. BUT mao had many shortcomings 
5. one of many of his shortcomings was that he had too much power 
6. Show in the journal what happened in orwell and what you should do but Mao didn't do that–he leaves that part blank 

## USE SPICE T!!! 

### CLAIM 
 >**Mao's cult of personality was his fatal flaw**, as the people, even though he had made many mistakes that even starved 45 million people, believed in him and his powers

>**Note:** use the terms “logocide” and “semanticide” (they mean to kill a word) 

>**ALSO:** MAO CHINA KEPT STRIVING FOR REVOLUTION TO KEEP HIS POWER, MARX BELIEVED THAT THE AUTHORITY CANNOT EXIST FOR A TRUE COMMUNIST STATE → MAO NEVER STOPPED REVOLTING 

## Outline 
general plan on the pages of the [handbook](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFCXHXezlg/m2gwwWTOamOV6bTHl0llew/view?utm_content=DAFCXHXezlg&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=homepage_design_menu). **Remember: all the text printed on the book is by Orwell and the person writing on it is Mao Zedong.** 

### Cover 
- title: *DIY: Rule your own totalitarian state!* 
- author: George Orwell 
- published: 1949 
- “Lenin says, ‘great read, I give it a 10/10.’” 

### Introduction 
- purpose of this book 
	- “Do you want to rule a country with a care for its people and never lose your power?”
- explains how it is based off of 1984  

So, you want to rule a country. As ambitions go, this one is certainly daring. Few people in history have overtaken this ambition, and even fewer have succeeded, even for a short period of time. After reading this short handbook, however, you will be on your way to lead an entire country to your will. 

But before we get started, there are a few things you might want to consider. Firstly, this state must be totalitarian. This means that you have complete control of everything that happens in your state, and no one has any right to disagree. Actually, no one has any rights at all. This is great for you, and maybe not so good for the citizens in your country. 

You might also want to read my book, 1984, for an example of how you might want your state to be. Many of the systems mentioned in this book will come from 1984. 

Your coming days will not be easy, but if done right, you will be worshiped for centuries to come. Keep your head strong, and lead your nation to the future. 

### Main content 
The main instructions and Mao’s writings will be here. Add activities for Mao to complete for him to include things he will implement in China. (ex. two-minutes hate and denunciation rally)

#### Ministry of Love 
Love? The name is might seem misleading at first–the Ministry of Love’s job is to inflict fear and pain. This fear and pain, however, is Big Brother’s love to the thought-criminals to remove their backward thinking *through* fear and pain. 

**Use fear and pain to control your subjects.** 

##### Thought Police 
- red guards
- the children in 1984 snitching on their own parents 
- also gets rid of intelligent people like syme 

The Thought-police is part of the Ministry of Love, and punish dissidents who commit thought-crime. They can detect every unorthodox thought through surveillance technology and even children spies, and condition its owners in *Room 101* with “love.“ Not only do they target people with revolutionary thought, they also vaporize intelligent people, like they did with Syme, whose role was to develop *Newspeak*. In other words, Syme was getting to intelligent for the party, so they promptly eliminated him. 

#### Ministry of Truth  
- rewriting of history 
	- Book burning 
- ![[Orwell and Mao's Cultural Revolution Notes#Censorship]]
>Who controls the past, controls the future: who controls the present, controls the past…

Chapter 2

##### Rewriting History 
In 1984, Winston’s job in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth is to rewrite historical documents to match the present. One example of this is in Part 1, Chapter 4, where Winston has to rewrite an article about a man who no longer exists, most likely because he got caught by the thought-police and vaporized. 

>“Comrade Oglivy, who had never existed in the present, now existed in the past, and when once the act of forgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authentically, and upon the same evidence, as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar.” 

part 1 chapter 4 

##### linguistic manipulation 
Linguistic manipulation can take on many forms, many of which we use in our day-to-day lives. What you must attempt to do, however, is so much more–change language itself. 

**Newspeak** 
The language of Ingsoc is Newspeak, an ever-evolving language designed to limit its users’ ability to think and express thoughts. This becomes very useful, as people communicate ideas through speech–limiting the means to do so will ultimately limit its contents as well. Change how the people think through their language. Remove the tools for unorthodox thought. Strip them of their expression. Turn them into animals. 

Keep in mind that this doesn’t always mean eradicating words from the dictionary. It could also mean the stigmatization of certain words and the replacement of them with euphemisms better suited for your doctrines. 

>“Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that can ever be needed will be expressed by exactly *one* word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten.”

#### Ministry of Peace 
- Mao’s constant revolution 
	- constant war with the counterrevolutionaries 

**Why?**
Warfare in 1984 has "no material cause for fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference," (1984, Part 2 Chapter 9). The purpose of prepetual war is to achieve the following:
- Justify the inequalities between social classes
- Deplete all resources for zero social mobility
- Place a state of permanent emergency for totalitarian control (martial law forever)
- Incite fear and hatred to enemies 

**What if I can’t?**
Even if there is no actual war, there must always be an atmosphere for war. A clear enemy must always be identified and criticized, and there also must be constant reports of improvement against said "war."

**Target your enemy**
Making sure your people know exactly who to hate is important. You don’t want your subjects to think–you have tell them what and how to think through speeches, propaganda, and education. 

Think about: 
- Who are your 

#### Key figures 

##### Hero and villian 
In any given moment in your state, everyone should have one person to love, and one person to hate. This one (no more, no less) person must be you, as someone all-powerful and knowledgeable. Someone who is all-powerful and all-knowing, unstoppable by any force in the universe–you. The other person to hate should be someone the public is familiar with, such as a government official, who has betrayed you in one way or another. 

As a dictator of a totalitarian state, you must be a person, idea, and force no one can resist. Build a cult of personality around you through ceaseless propaganda, and once you have the loyalty from your citizens, your cult of personality will only grow. Be the face of your revolution and a god for people to worship. 

This doesn’t mean that you have to be perfect. This means that you have to *look* perfect. This is where the villian comes in–attribute any problem to the villian, and you will maintain the love from the citiizens while they vent their anger at anyone of your choosing. 

Remember: anything you said was, is true, will be true. 

#### Closing Remarks 
During one of Winston’s writing sessions, Winston jots down this: “Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.” By “they,” he is refering to the proles, the mindless mass of people, ignorant, but happy. All the tips mentioned in this book serve that one purpose–to turn the people into mindless and happy creatures, unable to think for themselves. 

Before you go off and rule your own nation, keep in mind that you cannot fall into your own propaganda. The propaganda might display you as a god, but the truth is, you are no god. You’re just the same as everyone in your country, just fatter. Don’t let your ego get in front of you and blind you, no matter how well you think you are running the country. Listen to your advisors, and don’t rush things too quickly. Passion and excitment can easily turn to uncontrollably frenzy. 

Good luck, 
Geor
