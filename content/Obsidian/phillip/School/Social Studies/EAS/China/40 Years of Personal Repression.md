# 40 Years of Personal Repression 
Created: 2022-05-27 13:05  

From [this](https://project2049.net/2017/07/19/1984-with-chinese-characteristics-how-china-rewrites-history/) website 

The Chinese Communist Party has erected a narrative that the U.S. government is collaborating with groups in China to instigate a ‘color revolution.’ These groups, called the “New Five Black Types,” include human rights groups, dissidents, Internet opinion leaders, religious believers, and disadvantaged groups. As such, the CCP feels justified in the practice of rewriting history to discredit these five groups in order to delegitimize the United States’ alleged efforts to subjugate China. Personal stories of people affected by China’s revision of history throughout the past 40 years detail patterns that elucidate the calculations behind the Chinese government’s acts of repression. Just four of countless examples include: 1) [the purge](https://chinachange.org/2016/12/15/the-fate-of-press-freedom-in-chinas-era-of-reform-and-opening-up-an-interview-with-chang-ping/) of a journalist reporting on social injustices; 2) [the persecution](https://chinachange.org/?s=living+stone+church+guiyang&submit=) of pastors attempting to create an open church; 3) [the closure](https://chinachange.org/2016/02/14/guo-jianmei-zhongze-and-the-empowerment-of-women-in-china/) of an NGO that worked to aid disadvantaged women; and 4) [the oppression](https://chinachange.org/2016/10/22/record-number-of-beijing-residents-declare-their-independent-candidacy-for-local-peoples-congress-seats/) of a grassroots-level people’s representative. The CCP’s distortion of facts suggests that the desire to ‘save face’ ultimately motivates the Party’s harsh policies. By shifting the focus of the narrative off of the Party’s oppressive acts, China successfully hides its own transgressions behind a larger enemy— the United States.
