# Linguistic Manipulation during the Chinese Cultural Revolution 
Created: 2022-05-25 09:45  

### Linguistic Manipulation 
From [[Language and Violence During the Chinese Cultural Revolution.pdf]]
- there was a “centralized control of political language” 
- “In Mao's China, the language of political movements was always dictated from above: *people were never free to choose their linguistic symbols*. Use of the correct, officially prescribed language was an outward sign of correct thought, and failure to use that language was an act of rebellion.” [emphasis added]
- **The repetition of “correct” language reinforces correct thought and suppression of “incorrect thought” would have a great effect on the people's minds** 
	- This is very prominent with *1984* with doublespeak 
- The Chinese Communist Party 
- “technical vocabulary of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought” 
- slogans 
- “linguistic formulae” 
- Mao controlled all media which manipulated political discourse  ^a60012
	- people talk with the words they read in the newspaper 
	- Official press gave everyone the exact wording to use for everything 
		- especially mao's quotations 
- **Fear was the driving force behind the linguistic conformity** 
- everyone was looking to see if anyone slips up and says something politically incorrect 
	- “China descended into low-grade civil war” 
- “Political authority crumbled during the Cultural Revolution, linguistic totalitarianism flourished as never before.” 
	- counterintuitive

(This is mentioned in this article too verbatim) 
- Mao wasn’t always against the old: he sometimes “used ancient superstitions to foster hatred of class enemies.” (pg. 105) ^4dfad9
	- ex. revision of a book of ghost stories, *The Story of Not Afraid of Devils* 
	- “Its purpose was to warn that the people's enemies both in China and abroad were like ghosts, that they had the ability to take human form, that some people were 'half-man-half-ghost', and that all enemies with ghostly characteristics had to be unmasked and wiped out.” 
- Class enemies were called all kinds of evil, such as “devils” (muogui), “demons” (guiguai),  “apparitions and specters” (wangliang guimei), “cattle-ghosts and snake-gods” (niugui sheshen) 
- “It epitomized the dichotomy between appearance (human form) and reality (demonic nature) that underpinned the paranoia about hidden enemies during the Cultural Revolution.“ (pg. 106) ^7430a1
	- Increased paranoia for hidden enemies 

>The language of war, like the imagery depicting opponents age animals and treacherous demons, reduced the Cultural Revolution to a life or death struggle between polar opposites. If people took the words literally, then any cruelty was possible. 

>“Words, it is clear, do not just have meanings. They have psychological consequences as well.”
