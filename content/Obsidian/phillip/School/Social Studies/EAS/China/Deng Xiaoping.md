Created: 2022-05-13 09:40  

>"It doesn't matter if a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice."

Deng's logic: To redistribute money, we need the money in the first place. Focus on **economic growth** 

## Background
- Born in Sichuan Province 
- Went to local school 
- Goes to France at the age of 15 
	- To make some money for his family 
	- To get better education 
	- Gets exposure to Communism 
- Attends Sun Yat Sen University in Moscow 
	- Gets even more exposure to Communism as Russia was a communist state at this point 

## Back in China 
- Joins the Communist Party back in China 
- Survives the Long March 
- Organises the People's Liberation Army 
	- Gains the support of the army in the future (important for the Tiananmen Square Massacre)
- Becomes Vice Premier of China in 1952 
	- Thrid highest job in China 
- Friends with Mao, but had conflicting ideas 
	- Later, Deng is purged during the Great Leap Forward for counter-revolutionary ideals 
	- But even after that, Deng is brought back to the government to fix the economy after the Cultural Revolution 
- Then when Mao comes back to power, he is purged *again* 
	- The Red Guards throw off his son out the window 
- Deng is brought back to the government *again* to use the army to control the Red Guards 
- Deng takes the title, "Paramount Leader," and leads China 
- Didn't have the cult of personality like Mao 
- Focus: 
	- Economic liberalization 
		- Capitalism 
	- Openness to Western nations 

>Three inmates in a Peking prison asked each other how they had gotten into such a fix.
"I am here because I supported Deng Xiaoping," said one, referring to China's controversial vice premier.
"I am here because I opposed Deng Xiaoping," said the second inmate.
The two looked at the third man who said: "I am Deng Xiaoping."

## Four Modernizations 
- Modern Agriculture 
- Modern Technology & Education 
- Modern Defense 
- Modern Economy 
	- 5 major cities are identified as special economic zones along the East 
	- Placed all the factories there 
	- Open trade 
	- Increased manufacturing for everything 

## Tiananmen Square Massacre 
- Although people are happier, people, especially students, want political liberty 
- College students ask for democracy and do demonstrations 
	- Some see the government as corrupt 
- Protests start in Tianmen Square in Beijing and spread throughout the country 
- Workers later get involved 
	- This scares the government, as the government originally got its power from the workers 
- First instance of mass protests in Chinese history 
- Martial law is placed 
- Response from the government: clear the square with the army 
- In June 3-4 1989, thousands are killed and injured from the army's weapons

*Tank man, an ordinary citizen who stood against the tanks*

	- Most likely got executed 

>**Note:** China still does public executions. 

## After? 
- Deng doesn’t want more protests

- International criticism 
- Sanctions were imposed on China 
- The government says democracy is not an option, just economic growth 
- In 1997, China takes back Hong Kong from the British 
- 2001 - China joins the World Trade Organization 
	- China can now participate even more in economic deals with foriegn countries 

## China after Tank Man 
- Deng gives the people “bread and circuses” for a one-party rule 
- Much more foriegn investment 
- “China as the factory for the world” 

- students today doesn’t know the existence of Tank Man 

- china is still developing 
- china A: urban, has tall buildings, access to education and healthcare
- China B: rual, underdeveloped, very poor (75% of population)

- more and more people are getting angry 
	- poor vs rich 

### How does China censor?

- Western companies gave China the tools to identify online dissidents 
- Chinese press was full of rumors
