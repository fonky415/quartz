# Mao Tse-tung's Leadership Style 
Created: 2022-06-02 22:04  

>The secret of his greatness lies elsewhere-in his extraordinary ability to understand, evoke, and direct human emotions and the innumerable ways in which he has used his own persona to command the sentiments and passions of others. In modern China the realm of emotions has been peculiarly problematical: In traditional Confucian China the essence of correct behavior was the complete mastery and indeed repression of passion, and especially aggression; but out of the frustrations of impotence in the modern world the Chinese have been responsive to the appeal for acts of public passion. The need to ritualize emotions as a means of controlling feelings contributed to the traditional Chinese appreciation of drama and theater; and the modern need to find expression for feelings has multiplied the numbers of those who want to be heroic and to find drama in their own lives. Mao Tse-tung as a person has been uniquely capable of responding to this need of the times in China, for he is possessed of a personality that fits the definition of a “dramatizing” character whose skill lies in commanding the “immediate affective response in others.”
