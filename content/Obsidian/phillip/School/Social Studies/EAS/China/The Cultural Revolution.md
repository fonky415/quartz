Created: 2022-05-14 09:01  

The Cultural Revolution was an upheaval launched by Chinese Communist Party Chairman [Mao Zedong](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mao-Zedong)during his last decade in power (1966–1976) to renew the spirit of the Chinese Revolution. ([Brittanica](https://www.britannica.com/event/Cultural-Revolution))

## Goal
- “to preserve Chinese communism” (Wikipedia) 
>Mao believed that there were class enemies among them and must be caught through "the telescope and microscope of Mao Zedong Thought." MacFarquhar, Roderick; Schoenhals, Michael (2006). Mao's Last Revolution. Harvard University Press. (got the citation & quote from Wikipedia) 

## How?
- Purging capitalism 
- Erasing old traditions 
	- 4 olds 
- Impose Maoism 
- Forming the Red Guards 
	- “Denunciation rallies” 
	- Execution, harassment, torture, imprisonment, and more to anyone accused of the Five Black Categories 
	- Once their purpose was fulfilled, Mao dissipated the Red Guards to deprive them of their chaos in the case that they might go against him 
- Strengthening of his personality cult 
	- Publication & made compulsory to own and read Mao’s Little Red Book 
- Mao had full control over the press 
	- Fired the Propaganda Department director Lu Dingyi 
- Yangtze river swim 
	- Showed the world how strong and ready he was 
- Sixteen Points 
	- Urged not only students but the entire nation to join the revolution 
- Mango Fever (August 1968) 
	- Gift from Pakistani foreign minister, Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada 
	- Seen as something holy 
	- Put on display 

>Note: China’s relationship with the Soviet Union drastically deteriorated with the death of Stalin, ending Communism in Russia. The new president, Nikita Khrushchev, implemented anti-Communist reforms, which Mao openly disapproved.
