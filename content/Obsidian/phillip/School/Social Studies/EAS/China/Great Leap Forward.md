Created: 2022-05-14 08:43  

The Great Leap Forward, also known as the Second Five Year Plan 

## What was it?
- Economic and social campaign planned to go from 1958 to 1962 
- Reconstruction of country from agriculutre to communism 
	- Formation of people’s communes 
	- Abolishment of private property in 1958 
	- Industrialization with cheap labor 
	- Grain and steel production 
	- Backyard steel furnaces  ^7ea95b
- Similar strategies used in the Long March 
- Anti-Rightist Campaigns 
	- Quotas were overfilled and the government took all the “surplus,” leaving farmers without food 
### Hundred Flowers Campaign 
- Campaign from 1956 to 1957 where people were encouraged to criticize the Communist Party 
	- Today, people argue that it was a trick to reveal intellectuals and Rightists 
    >"Moreover, the experience of the intellectual classes following the Hundred Flowers Campaign silenced those aware of the folly of such a plan. According to his private doctor, Li Zhisui, Mao and his entourage visited traditional steel works in Manchuria in January 1959 where he found out that high quality steel could only be produced in large-scale factories using reliable fuel such as coal. However, he decided not to order a halt to the backyard steel furnaces so as not to dampen the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. The program was only quietly abandoned much later in that year.” (karma)

## Why did Mao do it anyway? 
- “Soviet Communist Party First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev proposed not only to catch up with but exceed the United States in industrial output in the next 15 years through peaceful competition. Mao Zedong was so inspired by the slogan that China put forward its own objective: to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in 15 years.” 
- Taking inspiration from the Soviet Communist Party, he decided to make the goal of surpassing the UK in 15 years 
- Also for propaganda 
- “When there is not enough to eat people starve to death. It is better to let half of the people die so that the other half can eat their fill.” Mao

## What did it cause? 
- Great Chinese Famine 
	- 15~55 million people starved to death 
	- Cannibalism in some parts of China 
	- Mao just didn’t deliver the grain the the people–all he had in mind was to repay the debt of 1.973 billion yuan to the USSR 
- Resistance from the people 
- Mao’s reputation being tarnished 
	- He stepped down as President of China 
	- He became the Party chairman and Commander-in-chief 
- Decollectivization 

## What did Mao do about it at the end? 
- Blamed the "rightists"
- Start of the cultural revolution 

## SPICE-T 
### Social 
- Counter-revolutionaries 
- Women gained more power 
	- Rights for divorce 
	- No foot-binding, child marriage, preventing opium addiction 
- People’s communes 
	- Replacement of money into work points 
	- Communal kitchen

### Political 
- [Denunciation rallies ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struggle_session)
	- Criticism sessions where people are publicly humiliated 

### Interaction with environment 
- Backyard furnaces 
	- Trees cut and & burned down 
	- Air pollution from burning wood 
	- Toxic gasses from melting steel 
- Four Pests Campaign 
	- Rats, flies, mosquitoes, and sparrows were caught by everyone in the country 
	- This caused massive locust swarms, as their predators’ population had been dwindled 

### Cultural 
- Banning all religion 
- Replaced with political meetings and propaganda sessions 
- Traditional customs were all banned 
	- Funerals, weddings, festivals, were seen as signs of “feudalism” and prohibited 
>“Among them were funerals, weddings, local markets, and festivals. The Party thus destroyed much that gave meaning to Chinese lives. These private bonds were social glue. To mourn and to celebrate is to be human. To share joy, grief, and pain is humanizing…could result in detention, torture, death, and the suffering of entire families.” Jonathan Mirsky, China: The Shame of Villages 

### Economy 
- China’s GDP shrank 
- “[...]greatest destruction of real estate in human history” (Wikipedia) 
>“Approximately 30% to 40% of all houses were turned to rubble. Frank Dikötter states that "homes were pulled down to make fertilizer, to build canteens, relocate villagers, straighten roads, make place for a better future, or punish their owners." Frank Dikötter’s Mao’s Great Famine 

### Technology & innovation 
- Backyard furnaces 
	- Complete failure 
- Agricultural innovations 
	- More failures
