I wrote this back in 6th grade. Damn. Wanted to keep it here cuz it’s gonna get lost in my drive. 

## Who the heck is responsible for the environment? 

Tue 15 Oct 2019

Phillip Han

  

Global warming and climate change is a huge issue right now in the world, and countries all around the world have come together and tried to decide on a solution or remedy on this issue. However, to do this, they need to figure out which countries are most responsible for climate change and what to do about it if they resist. Today, you will be reading how a country’s contribution to climate change can be measured, which can be used to finally figure out how we can know who is responsible for the environment, how to punish, and why I believe that China, is the most responsible for the environment. 

  

Before I explain how I will assess the responsibility of a country, I will first write some examples that are being done today that is mitigating the effects of climate change and reducing carbon emissions. 

  

One thing that is being done is the Paris Agreement. This agreement made a target for the parties part of this agreement - its goal is to keep the global temperature change from the levels before the Industrial Revolution under 2 degrees Celsius. To reach this goal, there will be, according to the United Nations Climate Change, “...appropriate financial flows, a new technology framework and an enhanced capacity building framework will be put in place, thus supporting action by developing countries and the most vulnerable countries, in line with their own national objectives.” The Paris Agreement is another one of those global projects that many countries are contributing, or just agreeing to help. 

  

Not all actions for reducing climate change has to be with countries signing forms. It doesn’t need to be organized by adults either. All around the world, children are protesting to reduce carbon dioxide levels to their government and are actually having huge effects. Even individual kids all around the world like Greta Thunberg are giving speeches in front of hundreds of people, motivating kids to protest. It’s great. 

  

However, countries aren’t really being very serious about this. This issue of climate change is most likely not on the top of most presidents’ & prime ministers’ lists, so progress is really slow. We can’t wait any longer. Earth is getting impatient. Making countries pay will be the wisest and fastest solution to this issue. 

  

During the answering of this question, I thought of multiple guidelines to measure the extent of the contribution a country has had to climate change. These varied from the nation’s economy to its carbon dioxide emissions. But then I realized: Why don’t I combine all of them together? I could put a nation’s emissions, economy, population, and more into one, decisive equation in order to quantify responsibility. I could also add some equality into it and have a bill to start with, and all the countries could have this bill, big or small. I decided to exclude undeveloped countries because they have their own problems including economic ones thanks to the effects of climate change, so only the countries from [this](http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/developed-countries/) list will be included along with the countries part of the UN since they are organizing all of this. However, they will only have 30% of 100 billion dollars while the countries in the list will be responsible for covering the rest of the 100 billion dollars. (The top 10 developed countries are all part of the UN, so I will subtract 10 from the total number of countries (193), having 183 nations to cover the 30%.) 

  

I chose the starting point of the 10 most developed countries as seven billion dollars (100x0.07), and the starting point of the UN members will be $163,934,426.23 (30/183), or to make it easier for everyone, 164 million dollars. If this sounds way too much for you, don’t worry - this didn’t start today. Countries and businesses have been funding research for a better understanding of climate change, more improved technology to limit emissions, and also for helping developing countries for years, and those have piled up to $1,068 million dollars for the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF). This means that now there is less of a burden to pay. 

  

The UN members now need to pay slightly less money of 162.25 million dollars, and the developed countries now each need to pay $106.8 million dollars less - $6.99 billion. Nice. 

  

With this starting number for each of the top developed countries, we can now put it in an equation that will decide the final payment through multiple factors. 

  

So here is the equation. The compensation will be determined by the country’s carbon intensity, the money they make from the industries that emit those gases per capita, and also the exports they make that have huge carbon footprints. Although this won’t be enough to give a perfect judgment on the country’s responsibility, it will be pretty close and will hopefully be sufficient. 

  

Data 

What is it?

How it affects the percentage  

Carbon intensity 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/97_LLwY5r6P-Q8sPee-Vp9NqAvg3Ko4Ak3fS7cb2_a3cTDyGKb20TR7tpgupa3o1dGLzNpsm5xUB3_4jNDIT-kqDtNMbkWm7CFOdOR-e6Xj2uu_12kcFUbZQsfLgXnP1OcHFcuZYJ3tioaQiHQ)

Carbon intensity measures how much greenhouse gas is emitted versus the amount of money made from it. OurWorldInData describes it well, “...CO2 intensity measures the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of GDP (kgCO2 per int-$).” So the more carbon intensity you have, the more you are emitting for the same unit of GDP. 

For every country, there is a goal for its carbon intensity by a specific year. So the amount of difference the country has from the target carbon intensity will raise/lower the final pay. 

Emissions per GDP per capita

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/AZVFDVTTLgFxaPiLcKfximLr8YwBYTqk82LhmiuTxJKgnlYb9Vu213fxPcu5W2Z6z7Dav0p2tsJMhEcOiyc0RT0i-IEuarW2NFGh6nvmBfT4P5J5q8N7VAjhlacP1fu3mHFcGiK9X3IKD42zCQ)

This is different from carbon intensity since this incorporates the per capita, meaning that the population of the country will affect this number. The more population you have, the less this number will be. 

The more money a country is making from those emissions, the better it will be for them when they pay. That is because making money is good for their economy and can also help the world’s too. 

Exports ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Oj87WMQqPpPKU1EpSjb9rHy9pHrW2eNQeJFZ5_r9KVzeyQQqKpevlT7tYphnKacL3Z09zvTHnY8csDFEo-7F7wAluO7mN_U-YqMXCEifPFKG3z9Wz18_cYDsztZw-CSCjwHbW4dOp0FY2d65pg)

This is quite simple - this percentage just determines if you are importing or exporting more CO2 intensive goods than you are importing or exporting. In other words, 0% percent means that the carbon used on all your imports is equivalent to the CO2 emitted to create your exports. 

The less percentage a country has for this graph means that they are exporting more products with carbon footprints than they are importing them. So for example, China is exporting way more goods that have big carbon footprints, so this will increase the amount they have to pay by 13.9 percent, in China’s case. But if they have a positive percentage, they will pay less money since they are importing more goods with carbon footprints than the goods they are making domestically. 

  

Now that I have established all the different variables going into the final answer, I will plug in the numbers for three countries one country and finally see if my prediction of China being the most responsible for the environment is correct. 

  

Key:

P=total payment for renewable energy 

p=original payment for renewable energy 

c=country’s carbon intensity 

t=greenhouse gas emissions target 

g=CO2 emissions per GDP per capita 

w=the world’s CO2 emission per GDP per capita 

e=ratio between imported and exported goods with high carbon footprints 

  

CHINA

Carbon Intensity 

-   Carbon intensity: -60% to -65% below 2005 levels by 2030

-   -60% of 2005 levels = 0.316kg ← target 
    
-   China’s carbon intensity right now: 0.59kg 
    
-   Difference: 0.274kg 
    
-   Their difference is 87% of their target, so they have 13% of their target left to go 
    

  

P=p+p[1-(t-g)/t]±p(c/w)-pe 

P= 6.99+6.99(1-0.275/0.316)±p(c/w)-pe 

  

Emissions per GDP per capita 

-   Emissions per GDP per capita above/below the world average

Exports with carbon footprints

P= 6.99+6.99(1-0.275/0.316)+6.99(0.561/0.325)-0.01(6.99)(-13.90) 

  

Now after finding data and substituting numbers, the final price that China will pay for is 20.9343557644 billion dollars, or $20,934,355,764.4. This number represents how much they are responsible for the environment and also shows how much they should pay to the UN for them to use it on renewable energy sources, developing countries suffering from the devastating effects of climate change, and other ways that hopefully someone doesn’t mess up.  

  

Although I don’t have concrete evidence why China is more responsible than, for example, the US, I can infer that they are, because the US always has higher/lower than China. Let me explain. When looking at the country’s carbon intensity, the higher you are than the world, the worse you are. ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_EoGiVhNTReEp9GhQ9l-Yj1yB6mx8EtpWeATUSxBPGdLkLQ6NpVtZ1-v27y8G7ErY4HaqMCq23pef-S1S_5zB18_LTboeGODntX7vv-Ec9W-3_JdmbfBhGCarfxQonl-MUJkgmpkhIqBGfwDNQ)

As you can see in the graph, the United States isn’t only lower than China, but even lower than the world! So based on carbon intensity, the US is at a better spot than China. 

  

Even for emissions per GDP per capita: the US has a bigger carbon emission per GDP per capita than China. ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Z1XIPEtUadw4JZdFV_scmMmGf-uqZ7HsOr26xNT9Duxr0-l9tRWDMiwM-FNpXjx1dMhNtzTNyCgFH1oQN9pGKwVxM8X7_RzGPryxonnUxpAjyxajib9luR3XNLMA6f3ibKDzyVUysTIRSz7gXw)

As you can see here, the US has a much higher GDP per capita for a lower emissions intensity than China. This too gives the US a lower price to pay than China. 

  

And lastly, the US imports more goods with carbon footprints than what they export, meaning that they don’t export goods that have big carbon footprints. China, on the other hand, exports more carbon-intensive goods than they import. This means that they are the source of a lot of carbon emissions the imports in the world has. ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/kVbF3furQHfGdo3ADbD0bZ7cC2pkZ8bhdUeGHfAXGLdtYOEUdu2Dx6h1e6cdXC5RZjuL5m1aZ_x0LhCoWQXbRCq1Qr9-pXUG-lS6kYSCbkmDgObUUbcq2c2B9foc2xWAwBFpzqFvTuPBQIe3Wg)

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Countries today seem to ignore this pressing issue of climate change. If this continues, the effects of climate change might become too severe for us to adapt to, let alone reverse it. We must give countries a number to pay based on their carbon intensity, carbon intensity per GDP per capita, and their carbon emissions in their exported goods. We must be more forceful towards countries that have more responsibility towards climate change than others. 

  

But Phillip, what if they don’t meet their targets and contribute to climate change even more? Well instead of just ignoring them like we are doing right now, we could have the sources of the carbon emissions be cut from them. The countries will have to sign a form at the beginning that the UN can do that though, to prevent any violence and misunderstanding. For example, let’s say that India’s major source of carbon emissions is burning oil. The $16.4 billion worth oil comes from Saudi Arabia most likely by ship across the Arabian Sea, so the members of the US can either block the ships going to India or make Saudi Arabia stop or reduce their oil exports to India. This will force India to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions or fund renewable energy companies to furthermore reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 

  

All the countries in the world are meeting inside a large, packed room on a hot July day in the year 2050. Although it’s stuffy and smelly, you can feel the happiness radiate out of the room. All the graphs in the room are one to be proud of and all the effort made has saved our planet. Renewable energy has been developed tremendously and the droughts and floods have become very rare. But the ones who have the widest grins are the people in their 30s - the ones who stepped out from school to protest for climate change all those years ago as children. They are the proudest of the work they have managed to achieve as children. As children, the ones who haven’t stayed on this planet very long, has saved it.**
