Tags: #EAS #History #Extract</p><p>This is a North Korean guide book about the Korean War in the &ldquo;Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum.&rdquo; Below the photos are some notes on the content, and at the end are answers to some questions.</p><p><img src="/quartz/Screen Shot 2022-04-10 at 4.43.23 PM.png" width=auto></p><p><em>"[&mldr;]who defeated the US and Japanese imperialist powers in one generation and of his warm humanity which he loved the soldiers and people boundlessly[&mldr;]"</em></p><ul><li>Though the South Koreans and the UN were pushed back all the way to Busan in August of 1950, they were never defeated; the war still continues in a cease-fire and Korea is split along the 38th parallel</li></ul><p><em>"[&mldr;] The heroic Korean People&rsquo;s Army and the people have been great so far. And in the future they will become an even greater army and people."</em> ^warning</p><ul><li>Maybe this is a warning to the US that North Korea will become powerful?</li></ul><p><img src="/quartz/Screen Shot 2022-04-10 at 7.05.50 PM.png" width=auto></p><p><em>&ldquo;The Korean People&rsquo;s Army inherited the brilliant revolutionary traditions of the anti-Japanese armed struggle built up in the think forests of Mt. Paektu under the leadership of President Kim Il Sung. After the country&rsquo;s liberation from Japanese colonial rule it was developed into reliable regular armed forces and made a positive contribution to firmly guaranteeing the building of the country with force of arms.&rdquo;</em></p><ul><li>idk</li></ul><p><img src="/quartz/Screen Shot 2022-04-10 at 5.10.21 PM.png" width=auto></p><p><em>&ldquo;The US troops illegally occupied south Korea on September 8, Juche 34(1945), forcibly dissolved the people&rsquo;s committees set up in accordance with the will of the people, and arrested, imprisoned and murdered a large number of patriots.&rdquo;</em></p><ul><li>This is actually not fully incorrect. When it was decided that the US and Soviets would establish a US-Soviet Union Joint Commission (USAMGIK) for five years before giving the Koreans independence, many Koreans protested against it. The USAMGIK responded by banning the trikes on December 8, 1945, outlawed the PRK Revolutionary Government and the PRK People&rsquo;s Committees on December 12, 1945, and declared martial law. This meant that the military had unlimited control for a period of time.</li><li>The last part with the imprisonment and murdering may be exaggeration, however, as I can&rsquo;t find any evidence of that.</li><li>If US troops &ldquo;illegally&rdquo; occupied south Korea, then USSR troops also &ldquo;illegally&rdquo; north Korea. A but confusing on whose laws it goes under.</li></ul><p><em>&ldquo;Having established military administration, the US imperialists set up the &rsquo;national defence HQ&rsquo;, forcibly conscripted south Korean youth and students into the south Korean army and expanded armed invasion in a planned way while pushing ahead with war preparations on a full scale against the northern half of Korea.&rdquo;</em></p><ul><li>I thought the US withdrew its troops in 1949?</li></ul><p><em>&ldquo;The US imperialists and the south Korean puppet army, having stepped up preparations for Korean aggression for long, launched a surprise armed attack on the northern half of the country at 4 a.m. on June 25, Juche 39 (1950).&rdquo;</em></p><ul><li>There is still debate on who attacked first. The KPA claimed that the Republic of Korea (ROK) troops fired first. It is clear, however, that it was the KPA who charged their troops through the 38th Parallel with tanks & heavy artillery. The KPA army was much more ready than the ROK, as the ROK had &ldquo;no tanks, anti-tank weapons or heavy artillery to stop such an attack.&rdquo; (Wikipedia)</li></ul><p><img src="/quartz/Screen Shot 2022-04-10 at 6.02.02 PM.png" width=auto></p><p><em>&ldquo;President Kim Il Sung issued an order to beat off the enemy&rsquo;s aggression and go over to a decisive counterattack at once and made a historic radio address known as Go All Out for Victory in the War. A large number of patriotic-minded young people petitioned to be allowed to go to the front and the KPA units went over to the counterattack and advanced southward, mowing down enemy troops.&rdquo;</em></p><ul><li>I doubt the young people &ldquo;petitioned&rdquo; to fight in the war, but were forced/threatened to do so.</li></ul><p><img src="/quartz/Screen Shot 2022-04-10 at 6.07.56 PM.png" width=auto></p><p><em>&ldquo;President Kim Il Sung put forward a strategic policy on liberating south Korea swiftly before a large US military force could be mobilized and led the military operations to victory at the forefront.&rdquo;</em></p><ul><li>Interesting that Sung is &ldquo;liberating&rdquo; south Korea from the US. It doesn&rsquo;t make no sense, if you think about it though.</li></ul><p><img src="/quartz/Screen Shot 2022-04-10 at 6.14.16 PM.png" width=auto></p><p><em>&ldquo;Busy as he was, guiding operations at the fronts, President Kim Il Sung made time to drop in at a country house in the liberated southern half of the country, treading a rugged path. There he met people and had a talk full of benevolent affection with them, saying, &lsquo;Now that you have become masters of the country, you have become able to live happily.&rsquo;&rsquo; In the broad liberated area the Workers&rsquo; Party of Korea organizations and organs of power were brought back 10 their former condition and democratic reforms were enforced. This enabled the people to enjoy true rights and happiness as the genuine masters of the country.&rdquo;</em></p><ul><li>Kim emulated Mao by talking with the citizens and building his cult of personality</li></ul><p><img src="/quartz/Screen Shot 2022-04-10 at 6.21.20 PM.png" width=auto></p><p>&ldquo;During the three-year Korean war the US imperialists dropped 546 400 tons of bombs and used even germ weapons without hesitation. In addition, they murdered a large number of innocent patriotic-minded people by the most brutal methods.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>The use of biological weapons by the US during the Korean War is still debated. Only God knows the whole truth.

The US imperialists affixed their signature of the Armistice Agreement on July 27, Juche 42 (1953).&rdquo;</em></p><ul><li>No one won the war. In fact, the war continues in a stalemate, as no peace treaty was ever signed.</li></ul><a href=#questions><h2 id=questions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Questions</h2></a><p><strong>1. What reasons do they give for the start of the war?</strong>
They claim that the South Koreans fired first and &ldquo;launched a surprise attack.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>2. Who was Kim Il Sung?</strong>
<a href=/quartz/Obsidian/phillip/School/Social-Studies/EAS/Korea/Korean-War#5aacdf rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Obsidian/phillip/School/Social-Studies/EAS/Korea/Korean-War>Kim Il Sung</a> was the leader of North Korea, appointed by the Soviet Union in the &ldquo;election.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>3. What are some actions it says he took during the war and how do they portray him?</strong>
During the war, Kim emulated Mao and conversed with the citizens personally, and acting like an ordinary citizen. They even show the tools he used to help the peasants with farming. Alls this propaganda (glittering generalities, etc.) him as a benevolent leader, who cares deeply about the citizens and is equal to them. Whether this is the truth is another question.</p><p><strong>4. Is this different from how American presidents are portrayed here? Explain.</strong>
In this museum, the Americans are called &ldquo;imperialist,&rdquo; and are portrayed as evil. No direct mention of American presidents exist in the book, but it talks about the US very badly.</p><p><strong>5. What are some military actions and how are they described?</strong>
The museum describes the bombs and biological weapons used by the US as &ldquo;brutal.&rdquo; Can&rsquo;t blame them for that.</p><p><strong>6. The Republic of Korea is referred to as “south Korea”, with &lsquo;south&rsquo; in lowercase.  Why do you think this is?</strong>
They believe that there should be no division between North and South Korea, and just calls South Korea &ldquo;south&rdquo; Korea because it&rsquo;s in the south. They don&rsquo;t acknowledge, or want to acknowledge the fact that the North and South has split and runs very differently. They are disrespecting South Korea.</p><p><strong>7. According to the book, what was the result of the war?</strong>
Kim and North Korea won the war when the &ldquo;US imperialists&rdquo; signed the Armistice Agreement. However, the objectives of North Korea was to take over the entire peninsula, but they failed. South Korea, however, wanted to keep their territory, which they did. In that sense, some argue that South Korea won the war. But of course, they both lost in terms of lives, economy, land, and more.</p><p><strong>8. What warnings are issued to the US?</strong>
In the introduction of the guide book, it concludes with: <img src="/quartz/North Korean War Museum#^warning" width=auto>
One could interpret that as a warning, but I&rsquo;m not sure.</p><p><strong>9. What is the overall tone of the book?</strong>
There are a lot of loaded words used in this guidebook, such as &ldquo;superb&rdquo; or &ldquo;liberate.&rdquo; This makes the book&rsquo;s tone very dramatic and patriotic, and makes it <em>very</em> clear which side the author is in. The entire book is propaganda.</p><p><strong>10.  Select one or 2 key words or phrases that seem different or strange to you and explain why.</strong>
One word that stood out to me was &ldquo;liberate.&rdquo; Kim viewed this whole situation as saving the south Koreans from the US, and from their perspective, it isn&rsquo;t wrong. Of course, Kim probably had ulterior motives, but it did make him sound like he was the hero.</p><p><strong>11.  Select one image and critically analyze it. What is its purpose? Why was it selected?</strong>
<img src="/quartz/Screen Shot 2022-04-12 at 6.18.28 AM.png" width=auto>
The images highlights the loses the US had, and celebrates their death and pain. This reoccurs many times in the book, where there are descriptions and numbers on the casualties of the US.</p><p><strong>12. Is this an example of propaganda? Explain.</strong>
This is an example of propaganda. It could be name-calling, as they call them &ldquo;defeat&rdquo; and &ldquo;death.&rdquo; It could also be fear, as showing all these pictures of death makes people fear Kim and his military.</p><p><strong>13. What do you think the government goal was in creating the museum?</strong>
The government wanted to make sure the citizens think that they won and also to glorify Kim&rsquo;s role in the war.</p><p><strong>14. What does this tell you about North Korea?</strong>
North Korea wants their citizens to believe that they are the best and are doing fine in all aspects, even if it isn&rsquo;t. Glorifying the leader is also very important, as the cult of personality makes people obedient.</p><hr><a href=#references><h2 id=references><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>References</h2></a><ul><li><a href=https://s3.amazonaws.com/coldwar/Korean+War+Propaganda.pdf rel=noopener>https://s3.amazonaws.com/coldwar/Korean+War+Propaganda.pdf</a></li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War#Factors_in_US_intervention rel=noopener>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War#Factors_in_US_intervention</a></li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_biological_warfare_in_the_Korean_War rel=noopener>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_biological_warfare_in_the_Korean_War</a></li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://fonky415.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Jacky Zhao using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://fonky415.github.io/quartz/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
