New York Times</p><p>Enraged by the financial crisis that has humbled their nation, Koreans overturned their political establishment on Thursday and elected as their new President <a href=/quartz/Obsidian/phillip/School/Social-Studies/EAS/Korea/Kim-Dae-Jung rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Obsidian/phillip/School/Social-Studies/EAS/Korea/Kim-Dae-Jung>Kim Dae Jung</a>, a legendary pro-democracy campaigner whom past dictators had repeatedly tried to murder.</p><p>The outcome was all the more surprising because this is the first time in Korean history that an opposition candidate was elected to lead the nation. As in Japan and Taiwan, politics have been dominated here by a single ruling party, and Mr. Kim&rsquo;s victory may help nurture the rise of two-party politics in East Asia.</p><p>South Korea is the first troubled Asian economy to hold a major election since the financial crisis erupted, and Mr. Kim&rsquo;s victory suggests some of the political repercussions. Mr. Kim was elected in part because of fury at economic mismanagement by the ruling party. But he also won because the ruling party splintered and divided its vote.</p><p>While Kim Dae Jung is widely hailed as one of the most courageous campaigners for democracy in Asia, there are also widespread doubts among international investors about whether he is ready to carry out far-reaching economic restructuring, and the Korean stock market&rsquo;s initial reaction today was anxious.</p><p>Mr. Kim immediately tried to reassure foreign investors &ndash; who have been profoundly alarmed by his populist instincts and by his closeness to labor unions &ndash; that he will adhere to the conditions of the International Monetary Fund bailout this month.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I will thoroughly implement a free-market economy, and I will resolutely open Korea&rsquo;s markets,&rsquo;&rsquo; Mr. Kim told a news conference this morning. &lsquo;&lsquo;I will make this nation a place where foreigners can invest with confidence.&rsquo;&rsquo; [Man in the News, page A8.] ^54cb75</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;We will diligently carry out the terms of the I.M.F.,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Mr. Kim, who had alarmed the markets during the campaign by calling for renegotiations of some of the terms.</p><p>To reassure foreign investors, Mr. Kim is hastily trying to arrange a trip to the United States &ndash; particularly to Wall Street &ndash; to reiterate his commitment to the I.M.F. accord and to market economics. Aides have been planning the trip for several days, in anticipation of a victory, and they say Mr. Kim could leave as soon as this weekend.</p><p>Final results showed Mr. Kim, whose name is pronounced kim day joong, with 40.4 percent of the vote, compared with 38.6 percent for his main rival, Lee Hoi Chang, a former judge who symbolized the ruling elite. The elections were solely for President; the next vote, for a National Assembly, is scheduled for 2000.</p><p>It is difficult to exaggerate the historical resonance of the scenes this morning as Mr. Kim &ndash; the man who was nearly hanged as a traitor &ndash; stood before a forest of microphones and accepted his election.</p><p>Mr. Kim, 72, still limps from one botched attempt to murder him, and even in the last few years his telephones have reportedly been tapped and his supporters have frequently been subjected to tax audits. Now he inherits this same powerful state apparatus that as recently as the 1980&rsquo;s was used to imprison him.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Since the founding of our nation, this is the most historic, most radical day,&rsquo;&rsquo; Mr. Kim said somberly. &lsquo;&lsquo;The Korean people made their choice and broke all the barriers, transferring power for the first time in our history. Democracy will take root and prosper.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Mr. Kim&rsquo;s advisers hailed their candidate as the man who could transform their nation politically and economically. &lsquo;&lsquo;This change of Government is significant, but the implications are even more significant,&rsquo;&rsquo; said an exultant Ra Jong Yil, a political scientist who is a close adviser to Mr. Kim, as he helped draft Mr. Kim&rsquo;s acceptance speech at the campaign headquarters. &lsquo;&lsquo;Our society is ready for change in every respect, including economics.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Mr. Kim will take office in February from President Kim Young Sam, who by law was barred from seeking another term. Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung are former partners in the cause of democracy who later became bitter rivals, and Kim Young Sam is now widely despised by the public because of scandals involving his family and because of the economic crisis.</p><p>Kim Dae Jung&rsquo;s victory represents an upset of Korean orthodoxy in part because he comes from the Cholla region in the southwest of the country, an area that is still widely scorned as uncouth and backward. People from Cholla have been largely shut out from prestige and power, and even today many Koreans would be horrified if a daughter began dating a man from Cholla.</p><p>In the Cholla city of Kwangju, ecstatic citizens poured into the streets to wave placards with Mr. Kim&rsquo;s face and chant his name. In 1980, in one of Asia&rsquo;s landmark clashes between people and power, the students of Kwangju staged an armed uprising and rallied for Mr. Kim and for democracy, but they were crushed by troops who machine-gunned protesters and killed more than 200.</p><p>As recently as the mid-1980&rsquo;s, the United States Embassy in Seoul regularly refused to invite Mr. Kim to its annual July 4 party, because he was regarded as a radical. Western diplomats seriously discussed whether he might be a North Korean agent &ndash; a proposition for which there was never any evidence &ndash; and army generals warned that they would stage a coup rather than allow him to become President.</p><p>It is a measure of Korea&rsquo;s growing political maturity that there is no talk of a coup today.</p><p>Although he was spurned by the American Embassy at times, Mr. Kim has warm feelings toward the United States. He has met President Clinton and has twice lived in the United States, where he cultivated his conversational English and studied American politics in action.</p><p>For many years while he was under house arrest in Seoul, he would invite visiting Americans to his home &ndash; surrounded by other houses occupied by security agents spying on him &ndash; and offer a Korean meal, political analysis and a bit of his Korean calligraphy. A rigorous Roman Catholic, Mr. Kim still has a huge annual Christmas card list of friends in America.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Foremost in our foreign policy is good relations with the United States,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Professor Ra, who is one of several candidates to be Mr. Kim&rsquo;s Foreign Minister. &lsquo;&lsquo;We cannot emphasize that too much.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>It is not clear how officials at South Korea&rsquo;s Agency for National Security Planning, which has spent a great deal of effort monitoring Mr. Kim over the years, will react to his becoming their boss. Some Koreans argue that Mr. Kim has the same authoritarian instincts as his predecessors, and will now use the state apparatus to help his friends and retaliate against his enemies.</p><p>Others argue that Mr. Kim is such an outsider that this is impossible even if he wanted to do so. The security apparatus has never hired people close to Mr. Kim, for example, so he has no buddies to elevate.</p><p>Although it is a democracy, South Korea still has many political prisoners, mostly radical students or leftists who sympathize with North Korea&rsquo;s Communist regime. A dissident poet named Park No Hae, for example, is serving a life sentence for leading a socialist group, and it is unclear how Mr. Kim will deal with the national security law that put them behind bars.</p><p>In the campaign, Mr. Kim was reluctant to call for freeing those political prisoners, presumably because he could have been called a radical sympathizer. But as a former political prisoner himself, and as a critic of the national security law, he may try to make South Korean society more tolerant of dissent.</p><p>Mr. Kim&rsquo;s main rival, Mr. Lee, conceded defeat in the early morning hours, pledging support to &lsquo;&rsquo;the honorable winner of the presidential election.&rsquo;&rsquo; Mr. Lee continued, &lsquo;&lsquo;I will not spare my cooperation and support to the President-elect, with a view to overcoming the economic crisis in an atmosphere of stability and reconciliation.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>This was Mr. Kim&rsquo;s fourth bid for the presidency, and to compete he broke a promise that the third bid in 1992 would be his last. His entire life has been a series of ups and downs, and it frequently seemed that he was destroyed and would never recover.</p><p>The personal cost has also been enormous. Just 10 days after his second wedding, in 1962, the military Government accused Mr. Kim of misconduct and sent him to prison. In all, he has spent five and a half years in prison, three years in exile, and six and a half years under surveillance and frequent detention.</p><p>During his first race for the presidency, in 1971, he mounted an unexpectedly strong challenge to President <a href=/quartz/Obsidian/phillip/School/Social-Studies/EAS/Korea/Park-Chung-Hee rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Obsidian/phillip/School/Social-Studies/EAS/Korea/Park-Chung-Hee>Park Chung Hee</a> and was nearly killed for it. A truck smashed into Mr. Kim&rsquo;s car in a suspicious accident that is widely regarded as an assassination attempt. The accident killed Mr. Kim&rsquo;s driver and left him with a permanent limp.</p><p>Two years later, while Mr. Kim was on a trip to Tokyo, the Korean Central Intelligence Agency kidnapped him from his hotel room and smuggled him onto a ship at sea. Mr. Kim&rsquo;s captors chained him to a rock, apparently with the intention of throwing him overboard.</p><p>But Japanese and American authorities had discovered what had happened and put enormous pressure on South Korea not to kill Mr. Kim. He was taken back to Korea and eventually released.</p><p>In 1980, Mr. Kim came close to being hanged, but in the end the international protests were so great that President Chun Doo Hwan sent Mr. Kim to exile in America.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://fonky415.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Phillip Han using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://fonky415.github.io/quartz/>Home</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
