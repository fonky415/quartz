New York Times</p><p>President <a href=/quartz/Obsidian/phillip/School/Social-Studies/EAS/Korea/Kim-Dae-Jung rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/Obsidian/phillip/School/Social-Studies/EAS/Korea/Kim-Dae-Jung>Kim Dae Jung</a> of South Korea, a longtime champion of democracy whose tireless push for national reconciliation led to a groundbreaking summit meeting between the divided Koreas in June, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize today.</p><p>Praising what it called his &lsquo;&lsquo;great moral strength,&rsquo;&rsquo; the Norwegian Nobel Committee&rsquo;s citation amounted to a salute for an unusually broad contribution by Mr. Kim to &lsquo;&lsquo;democracy and human rights in South Korea and in East Asia in general, and for peace and reconciliation with North Korea in particular.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Mr. Kim has reportedly said in recent years that his two most ardent wishes are to achieve peace between two halves of a nation divided by the 1950-53 Korean War, and to win a Nobel Prize.</p><p>Largely because of Mr. Kim&rsquo;s unstinting efforts to engage North Korea, a conclusive peace seems more possible now than at any time since the war ended between the two countries, which remain technically at war. And with today&rsquo;s award, Mr. Kim, who is halfway into his five-year presidential term, seemed fulfilled indeed.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s an honor that will not come again,&rsquo;&rsquo; Kim Dae Jung was quoted as saying by his spokesman, Park Joon Young. &lsquo;&lsquo;I am only thankful. Today&rsquo;s honor is due to public support for democracy, human rights, peace, reconciliation and cooperation between South and North Korea during the past 40 years.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>He added that he wanted to share the honor &lsquo;&lsquo;with those who have sacrificed for peace and democracy and my family and friends who have long suffered with me.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>In awarding the prize to Mr. Kim, the Nobel Committee appeared to have decided to finesse the sticky question of equal recognition for his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Il, who welcomed the South Korean president to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, for the June summit talks. This is the first time since 1971, when the West German chancellor, Willy Brandt, was honored for his overtures to Soviet bloc countries, that the award did not go to both sides in a peace effort.</p><p>At the very end of the citation, the committee diplomatically stated its &lsquo;&lsquo;recognition of the contributions made by North Korea&rsquo;s and other countries&rsquo; leaders to advance reconciliation and possible reunification on the Korean peninsula.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>The careful language amounted to a tacit acknowledgment of two important facts:</p><p>Mr. Kim of South Korea initiated and has often sustained the difficult reconciliation process at considerable political risk.</p><p>North Korea, meanwhile, although on extraordinarily good behavior for nearly two years now, remains with its missiles and programs to develop weapons of mass destruction &ndash; not to mention its lack of democracy and a woeful human rights record &ndash; a grave potential threat to international peace.</p><p>While accolades for Mr. Kim poured in from around the world, there was no immediate response from North Korea. But across South Korea there were joyous celebrations. The announcement came about 6 p.m. local time, and the sky over Seoul was soon filled with fireworks.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s an international award that is given to heroes, and that&rsquo;s what the Nobel Peace Prize means for the president and for Korea,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Jang Do Hyun, a 26-year-old restaurant owner. &lsquo;&lsquo;This president has done far more than any other president we&rsquo;ve had before, and because of his efforts for peace, I have been able to sleep comfortably.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>South Koreans cheered and applauded as they stood around large television screens at bus and train stations when Mr. Kim&rsquo;s name was announced. The choice was widely anticipated, and all television networks broadcast special programs to report the news live from Oslo. News broadcasts also showed residents in the president&rsquo;s hometown beating drums and gongs to celebrate the news.</p><p>The opposition Grand National Party, which has accused Mr. Kim of being too soft on North Korea by supplying grain and other aid to the communist government, grudgingly congratulated the president, while using the occasion to jab in a critical assessment.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Now, we hope that the president will have more interest in issues inside Korea rather than those outside and devote all his efforts to improving the quality of life for the people,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Kwon Chul Hyon, a party spokesman.</p><p>Mr. Kim, 74, is a man whose life has been so packed with high drama that its details could easily constitute the backbone of two or three life stories, with plenty of intriguing loose ends left over.</p><p>Born on the small island of Haui off Korea&rsquo;s southwestern coast, he ran his own shipping company and published a newspaper before turning to politics, winning a legislative seat in 1961.</p><p>In the tumultuous succeeding years, when South Korea was under the authoritarian grip of President Park Chung Hee, Mr. Kim successively became a dissident, an exile, a death-row prisoner, an exile again, a determined human rights campaigner and a champion of democracy, and, in 1997 &ndash; improbably, given that many Koreans felt that the military would never allow him to rule &ndash; he was elected president.</p><p>In 1973, in one of the darkest episodes of his life, the exiled Mr. Kim was kidnapped from a Tokyo hotel by agents of the South Korean government and was about to be dumped, bound and blindfolded, into the sea when agents from the United States intervened to save him.</p><p>And yet, his first act after he was elected president was to agree to a pardon of the former generals who had sentenced him to death as an opposition leader. This act drew criticism from some of his supporters in Korea. But it was consistent with a long-held philosophy, which has often drawn comparison to that of the South African leader and Nobel Peace laureate, Nelson Mandela, and which he had expressed to one of his sons in a letter from prison 17 years earlier.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Only the truly magnanimous and strong are capable of forgiving and loving,&rsquo;&rsquo; he wrote.</p><p>Mr. Kim&rsquo;s struggles have all been marked by an almost preternatural optimism, matched by a serene self-confidence, and a reservoir of patience, without which lesser men might given up, discouraged</p><p>Almost everyone who knows Mr. Kim well, or has studied his career closely, invokes his intense religious faith &ndash; he is a Roman Catholic &ndash; to explain his stubborn persistence in politics.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;This is a man who was under great pressure from the military dictators, but he felt that he couldn&rsquo;t possibly betray his convictions, because he fears God,&rsquo;&rsquo; said You Jong Keun, a longtime associate of Mr. Kim who is governor of North Cholla province.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;In 1971, when he called for peaceful coexistence with North Korea, anti-Communism was a sort of national religion In South Korea,&rsquo;&rsquo; Mr. You said. &lsquo;&lsquo;And he paid dearly for that. But he spoke his mind because he believed, and with hindsight, after 27 years, we understood that he was right.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Kang Sung Hak, a political science professor at Korea University in Seoul, said Mr. Kim &lsquo;&lsquo;is a man of conviction and of deeply held religion, which has only reinforced his belief in the justice of his positions.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>This is how, swimming against a tide of generalized skepticism among his country&rsquo;s main allies in the United States and in Japan that an accommodation could ever be reached with the North, Mr. Kim persisted until even disbelievers began to be convinced.</p><p>Until quite recently, in fact, Mr. Kim maintained his diplomatic efforts at engagement, now widely know as his &lsquo;&lsquo;sunshine policy,&rsquo;&rsquo; despite the utter contempt and venomous scorn spewed by the North&rsquo;s official propaganda machine, which disparaged him as stooge of Washington unworthy of serious consideration.</p><p>In an interview at his official residence early this year, when his government was still being snubbed by Pyongyang and, privately at least, drawing quizzical glances from Washington, Mr. Kim stated his ambitions resolutely.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I can simply say that I seek to see the cold war on the Korean peninsula over by the end of my mandate,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&lsquo;The North Korean leadership understands our sincerity, but they just cannot say so yet, because they must maintain control.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>The summit meeting in Pyongyang, it later emerged, was already being secretly negotiated between the North and South in China, which has diplomatic relations with both countries.</p><p>Not long after the summit meeting, the two heavily armed countries, which fought a fierce naval battle over disputed territorial waters just 16 months ago, were marching together in the Olympic ceremonies in Sydney, arranging visits between some long-separated families and working to restore rail links that had been severed since the war.</p><p>Fittingly, just this week came news that after high-level meetings in Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright agreed to go to Pyongyang soon to prepare the way for a visit by President Clinton. The Washington meetings, which were clearly made possible by Mr. Kim&rsquo;s breakthrough with the North, were hailed as marking a &lsquo;&lsquo;radical improvement&rsquo;&rsquo; in relations between the United States and North Korea, enemies for half a century.</p><p>They also testified to the extent to which Mr. Kim&rsquo;s policy of engagement has already transformed the diplomatic landscape, beginning to alter military thinking in what has long been one of the world&rsquo;s tensest regions.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It should be taken as a whip for further progress,&rsquo;&rsquo; Lee Jung Hoon, chairman of the department of international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul told Reuters. &lsquo;&lsquo;It has captured the attention of the global community. I don&rsquo;t think this should be taken as an end in itself. It&rsquo;s a beginning.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://fonky415.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Phillip Han using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://fonky415.github.io/quartz/>Home</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
