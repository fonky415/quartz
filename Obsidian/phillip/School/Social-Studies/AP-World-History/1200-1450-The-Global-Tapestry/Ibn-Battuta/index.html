There were a lot of Christians here even though it was conquered by Muslims, all of them who were really nice to us. Battua and I were pretty surprised that taking drugs were not rare, though. Maybe that’s why they’re all so nice. After visiting Alanya, we made our way to Antaliya. Here, we were welcomed by more Muslims, because the Christians, Jews, and Greeks were separated from the main city where the Muslims lived. Nonetheless, the Muslims were no less friendly and even entertained us with fun dancing and whirling. It was also fascinating to see the women treated much more equally than other places we visited. For example, they didn’t have to cover their entire face. In fact, men could be servants of women. That was really fascinating. There were still a lot of slave girls as usual, which Battuta took as gifts. I wish to return here someday.</p></blockquote><a href=#lands-of-the-golden-horde--the-chagatai-1332---1333><h2 id=lands-of-the-golden-horde--the-chagatai-1332---1333><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lands of the Golden Horde & the Chagatai: (1332 - 1333)</h2></a><ul><li>Barely cross the Black Sea</li><li>Reach Kaffa (Genoese/Italian colony)<ul><li>200 ships in harbor</li></ul></li><li>Merchants from Genoa, Venice, Egypt, Russia, and more<ul><li>Grains</li><li>Timber</li><li>Furs</li><li>Salt</li><li>Wax</li><li>Honey</li><li>Slaves</li></ul></li><li>Most were Christian, so only one mosque in town</li><li>Eventually moved to a place with more Muslims</li><li>Traveled with the King of the Gold Horde<ul><li>The northwestern khanate</li></ul></li><li>Battuta how well women were treated</li><li>Went to Constantinople with Khan’s third pregnant wife in 75 days<ul><li>Wife was Christian so as she got closer to Constantinople she started drinking wine and eating pork and stopped praying</li><li>Stayed there for a month</li><li>Saw the great cathedral of Hagia Sophia from outside</li></ul></li><li>Returns travelling in the steppe in the harsh Asian winter</li><li>Traveled through the regions conquered by the Mongols<ul><li>Pure destruction, nothing left</li></ul></li><li>Stays in the land of the Khan of Chagatay<ul><li>Descendant of Genghis Khan</li><li>Tarmashirin, the present Khan, made Islam the official religion</li><li>Battuta was treated kindly</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>After barely managing to cross the Black Sea, we stayed at a truly cosmopolitan harbor: Kaffa. I saw so many people from so many places from Egypt to Russia selling all kinds of goods. Most were Christian though, because they were mostly European, with only one mosque in town, so Battuta decided to go to a more Muslim place. We then travelled with the King of the Gold Horde, ruler of the northwestern khanate. The time we spent with the Turks was truly extraordinary, from their exotic food and the way they treated the women. Here, too, the women didn’t have to cover their faces and could hold a significant position. We actually followed one to Constantinople, the third wife of Khan, who got pregnant. Turns out that she wasn’t really Muslim and was actually Christian and only married to him for political purposes. Anyhow, Constantinople was also great. The great cathedral of Hagia Sophia looked majestic.</p></blockquote><p><img src="/quartz/Pasted image 20220831214522.png" width=auto></p><center><i>Hagia Sophia.

It was pretty nice in the beginning with the fancy house and all that money he gave us, but I should’ve convinced Ibn to get the hell out of here a long time ago. All the delicious dishes and fruits wavered my levelheadedness. We’re so lucky to be alive right now. Maybe it was the charity we did to the poor during the famine those years ago that saved us. I do sort of miss the landscape of Delhi, though. The massive, stone mosques took my breath away every single time, and I was absolutely stunned by the food there too. Anyway, Tughluq is crazy.

It’s paradise here. Sure, the rulers kinda forced Battuta to stay, but at least the sultan here is less psychopathic. Battuta got himself involved with all kinds of messy politics, but meanwhile, I had a great time eating coconuts, extravagant jewelries, and even some slave girls Battuta didn’t like. It’s pretty different here compared to some of the other places we’ve travelled. One of the first things I’ve noticed were how the Maldive women were dressed; they dressed very sparingly above their waists, sometimes not wearing anything at all. Considering that they too were Muslim, it was interesting to see the different standards here for women and clothing.</p></blockquote><a href=#sri-lanka-1344-1344><h2 id=sri-lanka-1344-1344><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Sri Lanka (1344-1344)</h2></a><ul><li>Visited Sri Lanka on the way to China to go to a holy site: Adam’s Peak<ul><li>Sacred for Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists</li></ul></li><li>Battuta met the king there and got his permission to climb the mountain</li><li>Camped for three days in the top</li><li>Getting out of Ceylon was not easy<ul><li>Storm</li><li>Twelve pirate ships attacked him</li></ul></li><li>Eventually went back to Calicut and from there rode a <a class="internal-link broken">junk</a> to China</li></ul><blockquote><p>Departing from the Maldives, I was pretty excited to summit Adam’s Peak, but after actually climbing up there, it was not worth it. It was interesting to see all Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists come up there and pray, but for my heavy body, the hike up there was not a treat. And now that I think about it, I don’t think the gods even liked us going all the way up there, considering what happened to us when we tried to get out of Ceylon. Or maybe they blessed us and allowed us to escape by the skin of our teeth.

Despite being a traveler of the world, I’ve pretty much lived only with Muslims and Islamic culture for the entirety of my life. Experiencing China’s culture was a completely new experience for me, and for Battuta as well. There were so many religions being practiced there, such as Buddhism, Christianity, and Manichaeism. I did meet a few Muslims here and there, though, which was really nice. Oh, and it was cool to see some coconuts from Maldives being used to make sweetmeats.</p></blockquote><hr><a href=#resources><h2 id=resources><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Resources</h2></a><ul><li><a href=https://orias.berkeley.edu/resources-teachers/travels-ibn-battuta/journey/delhi-capital-muslim-india-1334-1341 rel=noopener>https://orias.berkeley.edu/resources-teachers/travels-ibn-battuta/journey/delhi-capital-muslim-india-1334-1341</a></li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://fonky415.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Jacky Zhao using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://fonky415.github.io/quartz/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
