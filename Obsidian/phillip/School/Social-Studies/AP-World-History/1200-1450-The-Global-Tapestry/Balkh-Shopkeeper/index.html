My shop sold things such asÂ  grapes, oranges, water lilies, and sugar cane- some of Balkhâ€™s finest exports. My family was able to attend the Mosques in Balkh often, and we were content. However, after the Mongol conquest of the Khwarezmian Empire (which included Balkh) in the 13th century. I lost my shop, all of my family was separated, and I had to see the downfall of my once prosperous city.Â </p><ol start=2><li>Where are you from? What social class are you a part of? What things are important to you?</li></ol><p>I am from Balkh, Afghanistan. Since I am a shopkeeper, I am part of the middle-class, or working class. The success of my shop and the silk road trade routes is very important to me, since they affect how much money I will earn to sustain my family. I am also Muslim, so following the five pillars of Islam is very important to me and my family- we attend the Mosque as often as we can.</p><ol start=3><li>How did you interact with the Mongols? If you did not directly encounter the Mongols, how could you have heard of them?</li></ol><p>My interactions with the Mongols were limited because of my social status, but I heard things about them through other traders and people who came to Balkh through the Silk Road.Â </p><ol start=4><li>How did your roleâ€™s life change because of the Mongols? Was it positive or negative, and why?</li></ol><p>The Mongols negatively impacted my life because I lost my shop and my family. The city that I live in was wrecked, and mass murdering occurred on an uninmaginable scale in Balkh.Â </p><ol start=5><li>Why do you feel the Mongols:Â </li></ol><ul><li>committed particularly odious offenses in that they constitute a serious attack on human dignity or grave humiliation or a degradation of human beings;</li></ul><p>I think that the Mongols committed such terrible offenses because they wanted more trade and goods- since Balkh was in the ideal geographical location for being the centre of trade, they attacked Balkh. I believe that the treatment of those who were illiterate (being put to work) was degrading to them.</p><ul><li>used excessive brutality, violence, and/or savagery in comparison to previous and future empires;</li></ul><p>I think that the Mongols used more violence compared to previous empires because of the way that they forcibly siezed cities if they did not comply with what Chinggis wanted for them.</p><ul><li>and engaged in barbaric warfare setting the bar for inhuman warfare for future dominations?</li></ul><p>I believe that the Mongols engaged in barbaric warfare because of the way that they separated the illiterate people from those who were more literate. Specifically in the context of children being separated from their families.</p><p>Witness Role Biography:</p><p>I am a shopkeeper from Balkh, Afghanistan, and I am a witness for the prosecution. I am testifying today because I feel that Chinggis Khan had a very negative impact on my life and my welfare, and that the offenses he committed were brutal, degrading, and barbaric. My life in Balkh was peaceful, I ran my shop in one of the best cities for trade along the Silk Road, and I was in the middle class because of the success of my shop. However, once Chinggis invaded the Khwarazmian Empire, which was the empire that Balkh was part of, I was separated from my family, and my city fell into hardship. My two children were cruelly separated from me because of their illiteracy, and it is unlikely that I will see them again. My entire lifeâ€™s work that I had put in to my shop has been destroyed, and I now have no means of stable income to sustain myself at all.Â </p><p>Anticipated Questions and Answers:</p><ol><li>Wasnâ€™t Chinggis Khan good for trade in the Silk Road? He was supposed to have revived the trade there.Â </li></ol><p>Whilst Chinggis Khan may have made the Silk Road more accessible for more people, in order for him to gain such power and control over the Silk Road, he had to brutally take the important trade cities that were along it- such as Balkh.Â </p><ol start=2><li>The cities were given a choice to surrender peacefully to the Mongols- why didnâ€™t your city take that easy choice?</li></ol><p>Our city, or any cities in fact, did not owe the Mongols the surrender of our cities. These cities included our hard work being put into them to make them successful, it is rational for us to not want to surrender all of our work to cruel conquerers.</p><p>**</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://fonky415.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Jacky Zhao using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://fonky415.github.io/quartz/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
