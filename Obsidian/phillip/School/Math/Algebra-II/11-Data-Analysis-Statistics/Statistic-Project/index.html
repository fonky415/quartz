I think KIS students exercise for an average of 30 minutes per day.</p><a href=#data-distribution><h3 id=data-distribution><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Data Distribution</h3></a><p><img src="/quartz/Screen Shot 2022-04-07 at 10.48.18 AM.png" width=auto></p><p><img src="/quartz/another box and whisker plot.png" width=auto></p><table><thead><tr><th>Min</th><th>Q1</th><th>Median</th><th>Q3</th><th>Max</th><th>Mean</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>40</td><td>50.5</td><td>61.5</td><td>99</td><td>43.62</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A quick glance at the histogram and box & whisker plot is enough for one to safely assume that this dataset has a <strong>normal distribution</strong>. Furthermore, the spread of the data is compact, with most of the values close together. This can be seen through the high peak in the histogram and the thin IQR box. The data also has a center distribution and low spread. A few outliers are present with, for example, 1 and 99.</p><a href=#margin-of-error><h3 id=margin-of-error><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Margin of Error</h3></a><p>Population standard deviation ≈ 20.8
$$E = \frac{2\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\rightarrow E = \frac{2(20.8)}{\sqrt{50}}\rightarrow E≈\frac{41.6}{7.071}\rightarrow E≈5.88$$</p><p>The margin of error for the number of minutes KIS students exercise per day is 5.88 minutes. Using the mean of 43.62 minutes per day, the expected time for KIS students to exercise per day ranges from 37.74 to 49.5 minutes, and any other value outside that range will suggest that they practice more or less than the average KIS student. If another student conducts this same study with the same conditions in SFS, for example, and finds a parameter outside of 37.74 to 49.5 minutes, this could suggest that students at SFS read more on average than KIS students.</p><a href=#hypothesis-statements><h3 id=hypothesis-statements><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Hypothesis Statements</h3></a><p>The conjecture for the number of minutes KIS students exercise per day was 30 minutes. That is the null hypothesis, as that is the initial conjecture. The alternative hypothesis is if the null hypothesis is false.
$$\huge H_{0}:\mu=30,H_{a}:\mu≠30$$
Because the study showed that KIS students exercised an average of 43.62 minutes per day, which supports the alternate hypothesis, this refutes the null hypothesis, the conjecture. 43.62≠30.</p><a href=#conclusion><h3 id=conclusion><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Conclusion</h3></a><p>One day after my workout, I thought to myself, &ldquo;Am I exercising enough?&rdquo; I was exercising 30 minutes per day, and thought the kids at my school were doing the same. <strong>This was my prediction, or conjecture: students at KIS exercise an average of 30 minutes per day.</strong> In statistics, we call this the <em>null hypothesis</em>, which is symbolized as &ldquo;$H_0$&rdquo; above.</p><p>Of course, this was just a conjecture, which means that I can&rsquo;t say for sure that I am correct. To test my prediction, I came up of the <em>alternate hypothesis</em>, which is another prediction that rejects my null hypothesis. Only one of those predictions can be truer than the other. We can&rsquo;t say that one is true for sure, as there is always a slim chance that the data happened by chance.</p><p>When collecting the data for my study, I made sure to be as fair as possible by using <em>strategic sampling</em>. I did this by interviewing every student who has a prime number for the last digit in their ID card. For example, my number is 1604003, so I would be interviewed as 3 is a prime number.</p><p>When I got all my data, I organized it into two models, <em>histogram</em> and <em>box & whisker plot</em>, to make it look better and easier to understand. <strong>These models helped me determine how spread out the data is and the shape of the data.</strong> This dataset in particular is mostly centered, meaning that most of the data is in the middle of the models, and is symmetrical, meaning that both sides of the models are pretty equal in values.</p><p>The mean I found from the study overshot my prediction by nearly 14 minutes, at 43.62 minutes. Instead of admitting that I don&rsquo;t exercise enough, I had to make sure that I didn&rsquo;t get a high value just due to chance. Sometimes, you just get unlucky with your subjects and manage the interview all the muscular ones. I was too lazy to repeat this experiment, so I calculated what is called the <em>margin of error</em>. This statistic lets me know <strong>how far off my sample can reasonably be to the actual data.</strong> Samples rarely represent the population exactly, but are usually within some range from the true value. This range is the margin of error. The margin of error for this data was 5.88 minutes, which is nowhere close to 13 minutes I was off by. I would need to be extremely lucky (or unlucky) to have gotten 43.62 minutes if my null hypothesis is true, so we reject my original conjecture and say that the evidence points more towards my alternate hypothesis. I guess I just need to exercise more.</p><hr><a href=#pages-of-reading><h2 id=pages-of-reading><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Pages of reading</h2></a><a href=#question--conjecture-1><h3 id=question--conjecture-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Question & conjecture</h3></a><p><strong>How many pages do KIS students read per day?</strong>
I think KIS students read an average of 10 pages per day.</p><a href=#data-distribution-1><h3 id=data-distribution-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Data Distribution</h3></a><p><img src="/quartz/Screen Shot 2022-04-07 at 10.47.32 AM.png" width=auto></p><p><img src="/quartz/Reading Box & Whisker plot.png" width=auto></p><table><thead><tr><th>Min</th><th>Q1</th><th>Median</th><th>Q3</th><th>Max</th><th>Mean</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3</td><td>14</td><td>29.5</td><td>57.75</td><td>92</td><td>36.24</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Contrary to the first dataset, this one is <strong>skewed right</strong>, with the <strong>mean greater than the mean</strong>. This means that most of the data is in the lower half of the range. This is evident with the histogram, as the graph slopes down towards the right. The box & whisker plot also shows that the dataset is skewed right, as the IQR, shown by the box, is closer to the left than the right.</p><a href=#margin-of-error-1><h3 id=margin-of-error-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Margin of Error</h3></a><p>Population standard deviation ≈ 25.9
$$E=\frac{2\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\rightarrow E = \frac{2(25.9)}{\sqrt{50}}\rightarrow E≈\frac{51.8}{7.071}\rightarrow E≈7.33$$
The margin of error for the number of pages KIS students read per day is around 7.33 pages. The mean number of pages is 36.24 pages, so any value from 28.91 pages to 43.57 is inside the margin of error, meaning that any variance within those values could be simply due to chance. Any value outside of that ±7.33 range, however, suggests an external factor.</p><a href=#hypothesis-statements-1><h3 id=hypothesis-statements-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Hypothesis Statements</h3></a><p>The conjecture for the number of pages KIS students read per day was 10 pages. That is the null hypothesis, as that is the initial conjecture. The alternative hypothesis rejects the null hypothesis.
$$\huge H_{0}:\mu=10,H_{a}:\mu≠10$$
Because the study showed that KIS students read an average of 36.24 pages per day, which supports the alternate hypothesis, this refutes the null hypothesis, the conjecture.</p><a href=#conclusion-1><h3 id=conclusion-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Conclusion</h3></a><p>At this point, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re pretty comfortable with the things I talked about, so I won&rsquo;t take the time to explain everything again. If you are confused, just read my first conclusion again.</p><p>My mum told me to read more than 10 pages per day, but I told her that <strong>everyone in KIS reads around 10 pages too</strong>. That was my conjecture, or null hypothesis. My mum told me to prove it so I conducted this study.</p><p>In this study, I used <em>cluster sampling</em>, which is where you <strong>divide the population into groups and pick equally</strong> from there. For KIS students, I divided them up into grades and randomly picked 5 students each from grades 3 to 12. I did this by picking every 5th student from that grade who bought lunch. And yes, I&rsquo;m not including the lower grades because I want to divide 50 by 10 and the stuff they &ldquo;read&rdquo; is probably all pictures anyways. Call me biased, I don&rsquo;t care. Just don&rsquo;t mark off points for this. Please. I didn&rsquo;t want to interview 1.5 students.</p><p>With the data, I made another histogram and box & whisker plot and concluded that the data is <em>skewed</em>. <strong>This means that the data leans mostly towards one side or another.</strong> In this dataset, the data skewed right, leaning left. When I first saw this and later found out that the <em>mode</em> of the data, which is the <strong>most frequent value in the data set</strong>, was 9, I was very excited. I could finally prove my mum wrong once and for all.</p><p>When I calculated the average, however, it was way above my prediction again. I got the average as 36.24, which is three times my prediction. Just in case, I found the margin of error to check if this was simply due to chance, but once again, that wasn&rsquo;t the case. At this point, I thought about finding the <em>outliers</em> (a data point that is really far away from the majority) and taking them out of the average, especially after looking at the box & whisker plot, but I was too depressed from my second failure and learned to accept that I just need to get better. My mum is always right.</p><hr><a href=#potential-biases><h2 id=potential-biases><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Potential biases</h2></a><p>Here are some potential biases that could have occurred while collecting data.</p><a href=#convenience-sampling><h3 id=convenience-sampling><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Convenience sampling</h3></a><p>Convenience sampling is when the subjects are chosen because they are most convenient to ask. One example how this might have happened for the study of the number of pages KIS students read per day is that the subjects were chosen in the library. People in the library most likely read more than people who are not, so only choosing subjects in a library could lead to biases. There would be the same bias if someone only interviews people in the gym for the exercise study, as this is not a great representation of the entire KIS body.</p><a href=#self-selected-sampling><h3 id=self-selected-sampling><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Self-selected sampling</h3></a><p>Another bias could occur if the data was self-selected, meaning that people voluntarily gave data to the study. This could lead to bias, as, for example, people with only good data are willing to share. If I exercised 0 minutes every day, I wouldn&rsquo;t like to share, especially if the data is taken face-to-face, but if I exercised 90 minutes per day, I would like to share. This would skew the data left. There has also been studies where certain demographics volunteer to survey more than others.</p><a href=#recall-bias><h3 id=recall-bias><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Recall Bias</h3></a><p>As both statistical questions require participants to recall information from the past, there is recall bias. Not everyone has perfect memory and some overestimate their values while others underestimate. This variance from the actual value may cause bias in the study, as busy students at KIS, such as Juniors, may have more trouble recalling accurate values from their past than less busy students, such as Freshmen. Of course, the variability wouldn&rsquo;t matter if there are enough samples, but because there are only 50 participants for each question, meaning that only 12-13 people make up an entire grade (if the grade proportions are even equal), recall bias could be a possible bias.</p><hr><a href=#reflection><h2 id=reflection><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Reflection</h2></a><p>Overall, this project was a little iffy. Sometimes, I felt like I was writing too much and sometimes I felt like I was writing too little. Other times, I felt like I had no idea what I was talking about and was writing simply to take up space. This is probably because I didn&rsquo;t listen in class enough, but I also think the project guidelines itself were not clear enough. This was especially true for the conclusion part, as all the instructions that was provided for us was to &ldquo;generalize information.&rdquo; What is generalizing information?</p><p>It also wasn&rsquo;t very fun. If we had gathered the data ourselves and actually found out things we are genuinely curious about, working on this project would&rsquo;ve been much easier and more fun. I&rsquo;m sure there are a lot of problems to that too, but it would feel more like we&rsquo;re achieving something out of this other than learning about statistics.</p><p>In the future, I would like to actually conduct an experiment with the number of pages people read per day and whether or not that actually correlates with grades. Everyone says reading makes you smart, but is that really true? Would people who read more generally get better scores in IQ tests or the SAT? If so, which areas do they get better at? Does reading affect one&rsquo;s personality? Do you become more introverted the more you read, or is being introverted make you read more? Interesting questions.</p><p>What went well? For me, writing the conclusion was the smoothest part, partly because I procrastinated that section and did it last minute, but also because I like writing. Explaining the concepts was easy for me and made me understand them a lot further too.</p><p>The simplest things went wrong. I miscalculated the mean many times, mixed up the two questions, and wasted a lot of time and energy getting technology to work the way I want it to. But other than minor things, everything else went pretty well and straightforward. I&rsquo;m not confident that I will get very good grades for this project, especially because I just made you read a 2200+ word PDF document, but I think I know myself that I understand 90% of the concepts you taught us in this unit to the point where I could teach it to someone else.</p><p>If you actually made it this far, thank you for enduring the pain and have a nice day.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://fonky415.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Phillip Han using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://fonky415.github.io/quartz/>Home</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
